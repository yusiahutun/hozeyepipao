They may not necessarily be thinking about you, just preoccupied by their thoughts or events in their life.</p><p class=align-left>The tense feeling of having someone's eyes on you should not always agonise you, as some stares are as calm as you can imagine. When this occurs, you'll probably try looking away.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/c47b29091fa42a56.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to motivate your boyfriend through text when he's down</span></p></a><h2>Why do guys stare at me but never smile?</h2><p class=align-left>What is the deal with guys who never smile? Are they having a bad day? Has their boss scolded them at work? Do they just hate appearing friendly? You can never know what is going on with someone, especially if you have not interacted with them, so naturally, you feel uneasy.</p><p class=align-left>Having the stare of someone can be weighty on you, leaving you wondering what they are thinking about you. Here are some reasons why that guy is just staring at you:</p><h3>1. Anxiety</h3><p class=align-left>What does it mean when a guy stares at you with no expression? He is anxious. Anxiety can be a reaction to stress, being uncomfortable or uneasy. Some people become anxious when they do not know what step to take next.</p><p class=align-left>Anxiety is a normal feeling for many, especially in a situation where a guy is staring, and you happen to stare back. He was staring, not thinking that you would stare back, but now that you did, there was a sudden feeling of nervousness in him.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0301ffb4662082ca.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>12 subtle signs a guy is jealous through texting but pretending</span></p></a><p class=align-left>He does not know whether he should speak to you or remain silent. He probably wants to talk, but he is afraid that he will say the wrong thing, thus the anxiety. If you sense that the guy is anxious, you can try to engage him in a <a href=#>light conversation</a> to make him relax.</p><h3>2. That’s just their face</h3><p class=align-left>Some people just have that face. You cannot decipher whether they are happy, sad, anxious, excited or shy. They have that face which appears like a resting face in all situations. They portray a neutral expression, and it is hard to read their face.</p><p class=align-left>Do not judge such a guy if you catch him staring at you, as he may not have any serious intentions. Remember that such people exist and will have that resting face if they are not actively engaging in a chat or physical activity.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/eca287c0b20431f9.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to compliment a guy when he sends you a picture of himself</span></p></a><h3>3. They are trying to read you</h3><p class=align-left>What does it mean when a guy stares at you with a serious face? He is probably fascinated by you and is trying to read you. This guy has watched you for a while, observing how you moved and seeing your mannerisms.</p><p class=align-left>He is probably fixated on your physical features and wonders what your personality is like. Your body language will give him all the information he needs, which may come in handy for him if he has intentions of approaching you.</p><p class=align-left>The guy may appear creepy, but just play it cool and keep going with your <a href=#>business</a> to not give him clues about you.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/c47b29091fa42a56.png><h3>4. They are attracted to you</h3><p class=align-left>This may come off as strange, but some guys just stare and do nothing when they are attracted to a woman. They enjoy you being their view and are feeling some type of way but do not know how to handle the situation.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/cd69b6c09104962c.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>100+ POV quotes for love (romantic and funny ideas for couples)</span></p></a><p class=align-left>What does it mean when a boy stares at you but doesn't talk to you? He feels a strong connection towards you but is too preoccupied by some wild thoughts that he simply forgets to smile.</p><p class=align-left>He wants to look away, but his feelings are betraying him. In his head, you are too appealing not to look at. If you notice such a guy, try smiling first and see if he will smile back.</p><h3>5. You remind him of someone</h3><p class=align-left>You remind him of a long-lost friend, a former lover, a relative, or you just have one of those familiar faces. He does not mean any harm but is only looking at you to ascertain if you are someone he knows or whether he has seen you somewhere.</p><p class=align-left>Do you remind him of someone he dislikes, or is he confusing you with somebody? Coming up to you to tell you that you look familiar may be improper, so he stares. He is trying to figure it out in his head without verbally insinuating anything, but his eyes are betraying him.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/8891e23a72c2c04a.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What does it mean when a man avoids eye contact with a woman</span></p></a><h3>6. You are from different cultures</h3><p class=align-left>Why do guys stare at me but never smile? Some habits may be considered normal in some cultures and inappropriate in others. Smiling at strangers, for instance, is not a universal trait.</p><p class=align-left>The guy who is staring at you is probably from a <a href=#>different culture</a> from you. He may want to engage you, but given where he is from, he will not smile. He will only stare and observe from a distance.</p><p class=align-left>Russia, South Korea, India, and Japan are some places where smiling at strangers is not a common practice. Try to understand that this guy is probably not from where you are from, and therefore, his staring at you is just him being respectful and abiding by his cultural values.</p><h3>7. He is in a bad mood</h3><p class=align-left>Everyone knows what it's like to have a bad day. You do not want to talk to anyone, and everything feels dull. This guy staring at you is in a terrible mood and probably has had a bad day. Nothing he looks at is appealing, and everyone sickens him at the moment.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/9b1b8a636b616304.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Signs of unspoken attraction between coworkers to notice</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Why does he stare at me so intensely without smiling? His serious face has nothing to do with you. He is probably battling personal issues or has something that is eating him up from the inside. Look away and concentrate on what you are doing if the guy is not troubling you.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0301ffb4662082ca.png><h3>8. He is intimidated</h3><p class=align-left>You are intimidating him. He probably fancies being in contact with you, but for some reason, you seem out of his league. You appear well-put, confident and even too bold for him to approach. His shy side overwhelms his secure side, and the thought of going for you raises his hair.</p><p class=align-left>Some men are intimidated by <a href=#>pretty ladies</a>, and their only fitting reaction would be to look but not smile. If you think the guy is intimidated by you, gently approach him instead and initiate a conversation. Do it while smiling to make him feel cordial.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/9a38aaaac206b280.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to be the kind of girl guys regret losing. 15 qualities to develop</span></p></a><h3>9. He is predatory</h3><p class=align-left>He is a predator and probably has malicious intentions for you. Predators do not just target minors; they target people of all ages. Would a guy stare at you if he didn't like you? Very much so. He is a predator, and it is showing on his cold, unsmiling face.</p><p class=align-left>Use your sixth sense to move away from him, and avoid eye contact as he may try to rattle you. He is trying to be aggressive and will even do inappropriate things to get your attention.</p><p class=align-left>This is where you trust your gut feeling. If you feel like this man is a threat, then move away. Always be aware of your environment, and watch out for guys of this calibre.</p><h3>10. He is playing it cool</h3><p class=align-left>He is acting cool, but deep down, he wants to be close to you. He wants to smile but is acting all macho, so you don't misinterpret him. The guy is most likely attracted to you but does not want to show it because of a variety of reasons.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/d4a98aef316017a2.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How does a man feel when a woman walks away? 15 different ways</span></p></a><p class=align-left>He probably fears rejection or is still calculating how to properly approach you to make an impression. He is also playing it cool so that he can remain vague. By smiling, he may appear warm and welcoming, and he does not want you to assume that.</p><h2>Wrapping up</h2><p class=align-left>Why do guys stare at me but never smile? He might be attracted to you, have anxiety or feel intimidated. There are things you can do, depending on whether you are interested in them or not interested. If the former, compose yourself and approach them while making eye contact. If the latter, avoid eye contact and use closed body language.</p><p class=align-left>Tuko.co.ke shared an article about what it means when a <a href=#>man avoids eye contact</a> with a woman. Eye contact is an excellent nonverbal method for improving communication with others.</p><p class=align-left>A man should be able to maintain eye contact with a woman because it makes him appear confident. Eye contact helps your relationship since it helps you know what the other person is thinking.</p><p>Source: TUKO.co.ke</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tcHKqGWcp16gsnCywJyrrGWcnrOmtMCcoqxnl6q2pbHSaGxrbmVrhW7Dx7JkoK2pqHq0wMCrnGarnZ65pnnSoqSppJViv6at0qilrGc%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./zig-ziglar.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Zig Ziglar</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./vampire-diaries-music-not-bad-actually.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Vampire Diaries Music Not Bad Actually</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./20-year-sentence-2003-murder-ephrata-html.html>20-year sentence for 2003 murder in Ephrata</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./3-ways-can-remove-unwanted-blog-pages-google.html>3 Ways You Can Remove Unwanted Blog Pages From Google</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./5-rewarding-benefits-of-playing-the-violin.html>5 Rewarding Benefits of Playing the Violin</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./article-fbcffa51-ae5b-5b24-ba42-7821fc682093-html.html>Child molesters are the sweetest people | Columnists</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./woman-quells-racist-row-getting-boobs-train-html.html>Woman quells racist row by getting her boobs out on train</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaX.
