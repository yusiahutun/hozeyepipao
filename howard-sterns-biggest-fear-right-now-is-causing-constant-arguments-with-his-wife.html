However, there’s one thing that’s been causing quite a few as of late.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/09/GettyImages-459217140-728x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-howard-stern-s-going-crazy-with-covid-paranoia>Howard Stern’s ‘going crazy’ with Covid ‘paranoia’</h2><p>Opening up on his hit show, The Howard Stern Show, during a call from a listener, the media personality admitted he’s been “going crazy” with the risk of returning to the studio amid the late summer’s surge of COVID cases.</p><p>Stern has not yet had the disease that ‘shut down’ the whole world, however, it seems that adds to his <a href=#>health</a> worry.</p><p>“I’m going crazy with this. My wife yelled at me last night. We got into a fight,” he revealed, before explaining how paranoid he was about contracting the virus, and how he hasn’t had it so far.</p><p>“Everyone goes, ‘Don’t worry, it’s just a cold for me.’ It’ll probably be way worse. You know what I mean? I mean, I’m the lucky one who will completely fall apart,” he said.</p><p>His wife, Beth, 51, is 18 years younger than Stern, who is 69. Being “considerably younger” than him, she’s less concerned about getting the disease.</p><p>“You know, my wife’s considerably younger than me, as you might have heard. And you know, she’s not as concerned about getting COVID as I am, because, you know, I’m an older dude,” he continued.</p><p>The host then spoke about how his outlook on the ever-changing virus has changed over the years, as his wife has “a bunch of plans”.</p><p>At one point, he felt more comfortable going out and had the mindset of: “You know what? If I get it, I get it,” as he and Beth ventured out, even attending <a href=#>music</a> star, Ed Sheeran’s concert.</p><p>However, the new strain has once again added to his fears. “Then all of a sudden they announce there’s a new strain of COVID and it’s on the rise. And, you know, people are being hospitalized. ‘It’s time to go back down into lockdown.’ And I’m like, you mean I’m just emerging, and now I’m going back into lockdown!”</p><p>Speaking on how this creates arguments with his <a href=#>movie</a> star wife, Stern explained: “She goes, ‘That’s what you do. Every time I say I’m going to do something, you bring up Covid,’”, to which he replied: “‘I’m just telling you, I’m scared. Am I wrong?’” However, in the end, he ended up apologizing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/09/GettyImages-1052817798-693x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-stern-was-a-nervous-wreck-before-his-return-to-the-studio>Stern was a ‘nervous wreck’ before his return to the studio</h2><p>In October 2022, Stern made his return to his Manhattan studio for the first time since the 2020 lockdown began, for none other than music legend Bruce Springsteen.</p><p>The Dancing in the Dark singer said it would be “nice” for the two to sit in the studio together, and although the Sirius XM host was down for the idea, he admitted he was “a nervous wreck” the weekend before sitting in a studio with a live guest.</p><p>COVID testing was done prior to the interview, however, the 69-year-old admitted: “If I was going to get COVID, I wouldn’t mind getting it from Bruce.”</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmlxX2Z%2FcLTOsJirnF2owaa%2Bzaxkm6GXnLK0wIyfnJqqXae2qLTTZqWor12ewG6vwK6qoqaXYrCwutKtmKesXZa%2FqMHMnqWtq12strW0jKGgrGWnnrOmew%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./parker-mccollum-announces-a-headlining-north-american-tour-for-2023.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Parker McCollum Announces A Headlining North American Tour For 2023</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./sarah-michelle-gellar-80s-hair-makeover-before-after-photos.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Before &amp;amp; After Photos Hollywood Life</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./20-year-sentence-2003-murder-ephrata-html.html>20-year sentence for 2003 murder in Ephrata</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./3-ways-can-remove-unwanted-blog-pages-google.html>3 Ways You Can Remove Unwanted Blog Pages From Google</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./5-rewarding-benefits-of-playing-the-violin.html>5 Rewarding Benefits of Playing the Violin</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./article-fbcffa51-ae5b-5b24-ba42-7821fc682093-html.html>Child molesters are the sweetest people | Columnists</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./woman-quells-racist-row-getting-boobs-train-html.html>Woman quells racist row by getting her boobs out on train</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaX.
