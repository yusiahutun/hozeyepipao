In May 2016, Adam Rodriguez married model Grace Gail. Per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>, the couple wed at the Borgo Pignano estate in Tuscany, Italy, with their closest family and friends in attendance.</p><p>Guests of the ceremony spoke with People and said it was beautiful and full of love. Also, the Magic Mike and Magic Mike XXL writer Reid Carolin officiated the ceremony. How cool is that?</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>It appears Grace prefers a private lifestyle, as her Instagram account is secluded from the public eye. She only has 570 followers, which we suspect are her relatives, close friends, and modeling affiliates.</p><p>However, Adam doesn't shy away from sharing his marriage with his fans. His <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram account</a> includes plenty of photos of the pair, many of which show Adam expressing his gratitude for his wife. How freakin' sweet, ugh! Even better, Adam offers the public a look into his life as a father.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Adam and Grace have three children together.</h2><p>Adam and Grace are the parents of three precious children — Frankie Elle (7), Georgie Daye (4), and Bridgemont Bernard (~20 months). The actor announced the arrival of both his daughters on social media, starting with Frankie in 2014.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"I'm feeling so blessed today. [I'm] so happy with life and all of the beauty and love I am surrounded with that I wanted to introduce all of you that show me love and support, to the biggest, greatest, most fulfilling blessing I have ever received. My daughter ... Frankie Elle Rodriguez," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he wrote on Instagram</a>, accompanied by a photo with a newborn Frankie at the time.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>In Feb. 2017, Adam posted his first photo of Georgie, with the then-infant laying in his arms as he looked down at her: "I wondered 'How,' and you showed me," he said. "Thank you, my Georgie Daye."</p><p>In March 2020, a rep for Adam informed <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a> that their third child and first son, Bridgemont, arrived in the world on March 16, 2020. Adam also personally spoke with the outlet and said, "Bridge and Grace are feeling great, and his big sisters are in love — and so am I, of course!”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhflrGiuYyrpp2qmZzCpsaMsKCfnQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./emily-sonnett.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Emily Sonnett dating?
