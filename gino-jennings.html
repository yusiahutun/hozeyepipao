His wife is<strong> Darlene Gayman Jennings</strong> and they tied the knot in 1989. Together, this lovely couple has seven children in total – 3 daughters and 4 sons.</p><h2><span id=Career>Career</span></h2><p>Professionally, Gino Jennings is a popular African American religious leader. He is best recognized for establishing the fundamentalist and Holiness denomination of the First Church of Our Lord Jesus Christ, Inc. in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and embracing Oneness Pentecostalism.</p><p>This personality started his ministry initially as a Bible reader for his uncle in church. Following this, Jennings became a child preacher at the age of 13. During his adolescence, this personality claimed that God appeared to him after a period of prayer and fasting.</p><p>This led to the eventual establishment of the First Church of Our Lord Jesus Christ, Inc. after receiving divine revelation.&nbsp;Jennings started the church in his parent’s basement in the year 1984. Through teaching doctrines of inner and outward holiness, the First Church of Our Lord Jesus Christ, Inc. grew.</p><p>By 2016, this personality and his First Church of Our Lord Jesus Christ, Inc. acquired its headquarters in Philadelphia. Likewise, they also had numerous churches spread throughout the United States and elsewhere globally.</p><p>Through leading this newly founded Christian denomination, this personality has become subject to international controversy. Many people of other Christian denominations and churches have criticized this personality and the First Church of Our Lord Jesus Christ movement for some of their stricter beliefs and views.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-266837 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Gino-Jennings-during-one-of-his-religious-preachings.jpg alt="Gino Jennings" width=650 height=365 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-266837 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Gino Jennings during one of his religious preaching. Source: Youtube</p><h4>More Details</h4><p>Similarly, one of the stricter beliefs and views people have criticized the First Church of Our Lord Jesus Christ for includes their near-total rejection of women as clergy based on 1st Timothy 2:12. Another is a traditionally conservative dress code with head-coverings, long skirts, or long dresses, and rejecting makeup and jewelry.</p><p>Likewise, Gino defended his statements by saying not to listen to how he sounds but to what he says in defense of his interpretations of biblical modesty.</p><p>Presenting a staunch advocacy for nontrinitarianism, this personality is also known for rejecting and advocating forgoing the usage of the term “Christianity”. Instead, the word this personality believes more accurately describes his congregation’s faith should be the term “Holiness,” or the “religion of Holiness”.</p><p>Similarly, this personality has also attracted additional criticism for advocating a very fundamentalist Christian exclusivism via divine revelation for his denomination.</p><p>Moreover, this personality agreed to meet Jamaican entertainer Mr. Vegas for a debate in 2018. During the debate, this personality had Vegas escorted out of the building by security after an altercation that ensued between Vegas, the church’s audio and visual team, and the other associate ministers on the pulpit.</p><p>As a result, this led to the debate going viral throughout Jamaica. Also, two other ministers who agreed to debate this personality canceled. Then in the year 2019, this personality was banned from Australia.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-266838 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Gino-Jennings-interacting-with-the-visitors-at-the-church.jpg alt="Gino Jennings" width=650 height=806 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-266838 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Gino Jennings interacting with the visitors at the church.
