Before working on his reality show, Rick was just a normal postal worker.</p><p>On the 25th of January, 1952, he was born to his father, George Jacob Lagina, and mother, Ann Lagina-Cavalieri, in Kingsford, Michigan, United States.</p><p>Rick grew up with his siblings Marty and Matina. His brother was an engineer as well as a wine business owner who later worked with him on his project.</p><p>Talking about his net worth, the 69-year-old holds a net worth of approximately $3 million. While he worked for the post office for several years, but his involvement, in reality, shows significantly helped in adding up the numbers.</p><p>The adventurer of Oak Island and the star of a hit reality show, The Curse of Oak Island, Rick has been achieving a lot of attention as of late, especially regarding his marital status.</p><p>The 69-year-old reality show star has never mentioned his love life which has got the fans truly intrigued.</p><img aria-describedby=caption-attachment-1869 decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/famous-celebrities.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Rick-Lagina.jpg alt="Photo of Marty Lagina's brother, Rick Lagina." width=450 height=450 sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-1869 class=wp-caption-text>Rick Lagina</p><h2>Who is Rick Lagina’s Wife?</h2><p>Despite gaining massive popularity after completing five seasons of <a href=#>The Curse of Oak Island</a>, Rick does not prefer sharing his personal details with anyone. As it turned out, Rick is an extremely private individual who tries to abstain from releasing personal information to the media.</p><p>As a result, there have been no official reports on whether Rick has a wife as of now. Nor is he ever seen in public with a woman. Likewise, there have never been any rumors about Rick having an affair.</p><p>It turns out that before Rick achieved such stardom, he was an ordinary postal officer working in New York. No one knew him until he retired at a very old age to pursue his life-long dream of solving the mystery of The Oak Island.</p><p>Now, he is often busy shooting for his reality show that he barely gets time to do interviews. Similarly, he does not have any children of his own either.</p><p>Moreover, he is not present on any social media platform either which makes it really difficult to take a peek at his personal life.</p><p>News also started circulating regarding Rick’s sexuality as some fans claimed this 69-year-old to be gay. Unbothered by such rumors, The Curse of Oak Island star has not responded to clear these allegations.</p><img aria-describedby=caption-attachment-1865 decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/famous-celebrities.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Rick-Marty-Lagina-Net-Worth-Age.jpg alt="Photo of The Lagina Brothers" width=596 height=332 sizes="(max-width: 596px) 100vw, 596px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-1865 class=wp-caption-text>Rick Lagina with his brother, Marty Lagina.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaK8tr%2BMnJylnZKntrW1xKxlnKedZL%2Bqr8pmo5qfmaOubrnAq6minZRiwbB51qKdnmc%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jessica-chastain-beauty-nighttime-routine-interview-8635216.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jessica Chastain Beauty and Nighttime Routine Interview</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./christyturlington.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>CHRISTY TURLINGTON BOOKS THE ULTIMATE WEDDING SINGER</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./20-year-sentence-2003-murder-ephrata-html.html>20-year sentence for 2003 murder in Ephrata</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./3-ways-can-remove-unwanted-blog-pages-google.html>3 Ways You Can Remove Unwanted Blog Pages From Google</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./5-rewarding-benefits-of-playing-the-violin.html>5 Rewarding Benefits of Playing the Violin</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./article-fbcffa51-ae5b-5b24-ba42-7821fc682093-html.html>Child molesters are the sweetest people | Columnists</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./woman-quells-racist-row-getting-boobs-train-html.html>Woman quells racist row by getting her boobs out on train</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaX.
