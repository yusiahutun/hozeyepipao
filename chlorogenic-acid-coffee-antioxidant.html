Here are some more of the study-proven perks:</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>1. Better blood sugar regulation</h3><p>For folks struggling with high blood sugar or type 2 diabetes, chlorogenic acid can help. In a study in the Journal of Medicinal Food, folks who had the equivalent of 4 cups of chlorogenic acid-rich coffee per day saw a significant <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">decrease in fasting blood glucose levels</a>, body weight, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">body mass index (BMI)</a>, and waist circumference within 12 weeks. “Chlorogenic acid improves glucose tolerance, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">lipid metabolism</a>, inflammation and the microbiome,” explains Dr. Arnot.</p><p>Because of this, it helps reduce your risk of developing type 2 diabetes. In fact, one 10-year study found that people who enjoyed as little as one cup of coffee daily&nbsp;were <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">54% less likely to develop diabetes</a>.

Docs Say Sucralose Is OK In Moderation, But May Have Sneaky Side Effects</a></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>2. Improved heart health</h3><p>There are multiple ways that chlorogenic acid has been shown to improve heart health, including lowering high blood pressure and improving the health of blood vessels. A review in the Journal of Human Hypertension looked at seven different studies encompassing hundreds of people with high blood pressure. They found that consuming chlorogenic acid <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">reduced both systolic and diastolic blood pressure</a> by an average of 4 points each.</p><p>Meanwhile, a separate study in the European Journal of Nutrition found that just a single cup of CGA-rich coffee <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">improves blood flow through the arteries</a> by 20% after one hour and 33% after two hours. This eases strain on your ticker.

Speedier weight loss</h3><p>Just 2 cups of high-chlorogenic acid coffee per day is enough to aid weight loss, according to a study in the journal Nutrients. Researchers found that those who sipped CGA-rich brews daily for 12 weeks saw up to a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">25% reduction in visceral fat</a>, the dangerous fat that settles around your organs, and up to a 13% reduction in total fat. Plus they reduced their waist circumference and total body weight. The researchers suspect that the CGA increases energy expenditure and fat burning, making it easier to melt stubborn pounds.</p><p><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=#>Dr. Bob Arnot: Swap Your Dark Roast Coffee for a Lighter Roast for Automatic Weight Loss</a></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>4. A healthier liver</h3><p>“Chlorogenic acid plays one of the most important roles in coffee’s positive impact on liver health,” says Revi. The proof: A study in Frontiers in Pharmacology found that chlorogenic acid <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">reversed the negative effects of a high fat diet on the liver</a>. Specifically, it alleviated inflammation, lowered blood lipid levels and improved other factors associated with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">non-alcoholic fatty liver disease</a>. (Click through to learn how the chlorogenic acid in coffee <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">eases gout</a>, too)</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How to get the most chlorogenic acid in coffee</h2><p>Since it is naturally occurring in the coffee plant, all coffee contains some concentration of chlorogenic acid. That said, there are steps you can take to maximize how much you get in every cup.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>1. Choose lighter roasts</h3><p>Always opt for a light or medium roast over a darker roast, since some chlorogenic acid is lost during roasting. “Once you roast a bean beyond a medium, 75% of the polyphenols are burned off,” notes Dr. Arnot.&nbsp;</p><p>As far as coffee type, Revi says to go with a high quality <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">robusta coffee</a> over a pricier <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">arabica</a>. “Robusta coffees are higher in CGA content than arabica coffees, even though arabica coffees are considered higher quality and more palatable,” she notes. “Robusta coffees are a large part of the commercial coffee supply chain and generally available everywhere.” Other things to keep in mind when making this choice: Robusta coffees tend to have more caffeine and a more distinct and bitter “coffee” flavor.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>2. Drink it black if you can</h3><p>Compounds in full-fat dairy have been shown to bind to the polyphenols in coffee and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">prevent them from being absorbed</a>, so try to skip the milk and dairy-based creamers. If you do need to add something, consider a splash of coconut, almond or oat milk. “These high-polyphenol coffees contain notes of chocolate, honey, hazelnut, and berries,” Dr. Arnot says. “They have wonderful, complex tastes. You won’t want to add anything because it tastes great on its own.” (Tip: Click through to learn how plain coffee can ease a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">migraine and tension headache</a>, too.)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/GettyImages-1207504993-2.jpg><h3 class=wp-block-heading>3. Sip 3-4 cups a day</h3><p>Dr. Arnot suggests getting 1,000 mg of chlorogenic acid in coffee per day to reap the health benefits. According to a study in the journal <a href=#>Molecules</a>, the amount of CGA in one cup of coffee can range from 70-350 mg. That means if you follow the above tips, you should be able to come close to 1,000 mg with 3-4 cups. If that sounds like too much caffeine, don’t worry: Decaf coffee contains chlorogenic acid as well, just a little bit less. “The very best decafs have about 25% fewer polyphenols than caffeinated coffees,” Dr. Arnot explains. So if you’re going all decaf, you may need to drink a bit more.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Not a coffee drinker?</h2><p>Dr. Arnot notes that drinking coffee is the best way to get the benefits of chlorogenic acid, since compounds in the brew work synergistically to help the body absorb it. “Coffee works because it gets into the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">microbiome</a> and transforms it,” he explains.&nbsp;“I would stick with coffee” if you can. That said, you can try supplementing with chlorogenic acid, often found as green coffee extract, instead.
