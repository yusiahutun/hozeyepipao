"Everyone is weird in their own way."</p><p>Before sitting down for an in-depth interview, Hammack delivered a rousing performance of the observant, upbeat tune — her soulful voice&nbsp;matching&nbsp;her vibrant expressions. The lyrics nod to each of her family member's quirks, like how her father is asleep in his armchair with the game on TV while her mom is burning chicken. And if opening line "sister smoked all the Camels in the county last week" isn't enough to make&nbsp;you chuckle, Hammack throws in a joke about her grandma selling her Maytag dryer to post her uncle's bail for good measure.</p><p>"Some of us got problems / But they love us anyway / Through think and thin / Hell we're still kin / At the end of the day," she chants.</p><p>"I feel like my family has always been a very strong family, we're very close. Whenever someone's hurt, everyone knows about it. If someone has a sinus infection in our family, everyone knows about it and we're praying," the singer explains.&nbsp;"I'm surrounded by good people. All of us have our flaws, all of us have our weird spots and our dark places, but I'm surrounded continually by people that are smiling for the most part."</p><p>Hammack is the fourth artist to be selected as part of the RISERS class&nbsp;of 2019.&nbsp;We pick an up-and-coming&nbsp;act who is poised for a breakthrough in country music and ask them to perform a few songs: Their current&nbsp;single and a cover of a song that's meaningful to them. Over the course of&nbsp;the next few months, you'll learn why Hammack fell in love with classic country music, how a cover of Gloria Gaynor's "I Will Survive" helped launch her career and how a fire that destroyed her home also gave her a positive perspective on life.</p><p><strong>RISER Riley Green Has a Personal Song About Family Too:</strong></p><p><strong>See the Most Powerful Women In Country Music History:&nbsp;</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmnJmpobKmeceapKaZk6B6p63MoqOyZaSnsqZ7</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kirsten-dunsts-red-carpet-style.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kirsten Dunst's Best Red Carpet Looks Through the Years</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./joe-ambrosole.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Joe Ambrosole dating?
