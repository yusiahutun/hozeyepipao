It was Charles all along. According to Christopher Andersen's Brothers And Wives: Inside The Private Lives of William, Kate, Harry and Meghan, Charles is the unnamed royal who allegedly asked what color Archie's skin color was after he was born. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="noopener nofollow">Reports</a> came out after Archie's birth that the royals were concerned with how dark he would be — something that Meghan spoke about during her Oprah interview — though there were never any names, until now.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I wonder what the children will look like?" Charles asked Camilla after Harry and Meghan's engagement, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=noopener>Page Six</a> reported. Sources cited in the book say that the conversation happened on Nov. 27, 2017, the day the engagement was officially announced. Anderson doesn't name Charles outright, but he does present a very telling conversation that would have readers believe that Charles was the one making incendiary remarks.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">His book recounts that Camilla was "taken aback somewhat by the question" and added that Archie would be "absolutely gorgeous."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The allegations go on to say that Charles lowered his voice and asked: "I mean, what do you suppose their children's complexion might be?"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A spokesman for Charles from Clarence House denied the claim, saying: "This is fiction and not worth further comment."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Photo by Daniel Leal - WPA Pool/Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"On the morning that Meghan and Harry's engagement was announced, in a very kind of benign way, Prince Charles started to muse on what their future grandchildren might look like," Andersen told Hoda Kotb and Savannah Guthrie during an appearance on the Today show. "I mean, here's this beautiful biracial American woman and the world's most famous redhead. I'm a grandfather, of course, we all do this, speculate on it. But it was turned into something very toxic, it was weaponized by the 'Men in Gray' who run the palace organization. Unfortunately, by the time it got to Harry, that's the way he took it."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Page Six notes that the Men in Gray are a gossipy clique-slash-"old boys' network" within the palace.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Anderson also shared Harry's frustration after the incident, though he writes that Charles felt that his son was being "overly sensitive about the matter." The author also claims that William would go on to defend his father, saying that Charles's comments were "tactless" but "not a sign of racism within the family."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wp6jnpqinsG6e8%2BroKeblWKwqa3RpZysZ5Odv6q%2F06inoZ2iYq6vsMSrqp6mXae8uq3LrGSbp5%2BgerG%2ByKeanmWTna6zuMSsZJqqk522pnnSpKCnZZOkubC%2B</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./65a3c24e22601db4648b45b0-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Why is Jerry Krause hated in Chicago: Fights with Michael Jordan, tricks and obsessions</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./rhea-perlman-reflects-danny-devito-split-35-years-married-fondly-remembers-glory-days-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Rhea Perlman reflects on Danny Devito split after 35 years married, fondly remembers 'glory days'</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./20-year-sentence-2003-murder-ephrata-html.html>20-year sentence for 2003 murder in Ephrata</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./3-ways-can-remove-unwanted-blog-pages-google.html>3 Ways You Can Remove Unwanted Blog Pages From Google</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./5-rewarding-benefits-of-playing-the-violin.html>5 Rewarding Benefits of Playing the Violin</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./article-fbcffa51-ae5b-5b24-ba42-7821fc682093-html.html>Child molesters are the sweetest people | Columnists</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./woman-quells-racist-row-getting-boobs-train-html.html>Woman quells racist row by getting her boobs out on train</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaX.
