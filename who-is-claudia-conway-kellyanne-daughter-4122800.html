In a preview clip for the show, which you can see below, Claudia’s parents both make appearances in-person and on the virtual wall. At one point, Katy seemingly addresses Claudia by telling her “we want an American Idol.” But through it all, Claudia seems ready to take this new journey and hopefully get a golden ticket!</p><p id=content-paragraph-15>“I’m very nervous, but very excited,” she tells the camera in the preview. Since the footage dropped, Claudia has taken to her TikTok account and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>teased her audition</a> for the show. “They saw a video I posted as a joke of me singing and they were like, ‘Do you wanna audition?’ and I’m like….oh s***. Yeah. Who wouldn’t? Everyone thinks this is a publicity stunt or me trying to be…whatever…but music is a passion,” she shared on February 8.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>You heard that right. <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>@claudiamconwayy</a> is looking for a golden ticket 🤯🎤 Find out Sunday if she has what it takes to be <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>#TheNextIdol</a> on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>#AmericanIdol</a> 🌟 <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>https://t.co/DyjZWk2w1r</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-16>— American Idol (@AmericanIdol) <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>February 9, 2021</a></p><h2>Claudia’s Relationship With Kellyanne</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Claudia-Conway-5-Things-Spl-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-18>“I think I want everyone to know that. My mom is the strongest person I know and she’s 100% a feminist,” Claudia said in her <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Insider</a> interview. She said that she struggles with people thinking that she must be a Trump supporter like her mother. Kellyanne asked that she take down her viral TikToks about Trump, but Claudia declined.</p><p id=content-paragraph-19>She’s not the only liberal in the family who butts heads with her mom. Claudia’s father, <strong>George Conway</strong>, is a staunch Trump opponent who publicly criticizes him. He even started the anti-Trump conservative PAC <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Lincoln Project</a>. So, it’s really no surprise that Kellyanne is fine with her daughter expressing different political views.</p><p id=content-paragraph-20>Despite her mother being the former president’s one-time counselor and one of his fiercest defenders, Claudia isn’t conservative. She was just 12 years old when she moved to Washington, DC, from New Jersey for her mom’s job. “I’m still a kid, of course,” Claudia told Insider. “I took the time to educate myself and took the time to branch out and be exposed to other sides and other biases and whatnot.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-21>The teenager confessed that she and her mother do argue about politics. “I’m not going to lie. My mom is my best friend but we do fight all the time over politics, and I’m always shut down by my entire family,” she said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/claudia-conway-5-things-to-know-abc-embed.jpg><h2>Claudia Is A Political Activist</h2><p id=content-paragraph-22>Claudia is an activist deeply involved with <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Black Lives Matter</a> and LGBTQIA+ rights movements. The teenager marched in Washington, DC in the very protests that her mother’s boss tried to stop in 2020 with the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Insurrection Act</a>. Her TikTok and Instagram pages reflect her work. One photo on Instagram shows the barricades Trump temporarily put up around the White House. She wrote as the caption, “To the black community, YOU matter. all black lives matter. black women. black men. black LGTBQIA+. you all matter. keep fighting. this isn’t over yet. to non-black people, like myself, we must use our privilege for good. we MUST be allies.</p><p id=content-paragraph-23>“We must listen. we must educate ourselves,” <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>she continued</a>. “we ALL must advocate. this isn’t a matter of bipartisan politics. we all must check our bias at the door. we must check our political affiliations at the door. this is a human rights movement. we must come together. we will not stop speaking out until an end is put to this. let’s end systemic racism and destroy the agenda of institutional racism. let’s get on the RIGHT side of history.” She also took to TikTok in July 2022 to share a series of <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>photos</a> of herself at a woman’s reproductive rights protest (see video above).</p><h2>Claudia Is A TikTok Star</h2><a title=@claudiamconway href=# rel=nofollow>@claudiamconway</a><p id=content-paragraph-24><a title="♬ original sound - joker" href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>♬ original sound – joker</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-26>Her most viral video (since deleted) featured Claudia telling a follower that she can have different viewpoints from her mother. “Believe it or not, you can have your own opinions not influenced by your parents at all,” she says in the clip. She asked Trump supporters to please stop commenting things like “Trump 2020” on her posts. She told Insider that she wants to use her TikTok platform to “inform people and spread love.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-27>“I believe that ignorance stems from a lack of education and a lack of knowledge and I believe knowledge is power,” she said. “Even if you have opposite views of me as long as you’re informed and able to see both sides that’s all that really matters.”</p><h2>Claudia Is A Mental Health Advocate</h2><p id=content-paragraph-28>Claudia penned a passionate post on Instagram in May for <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Mental Health Awareness month</a>, revealing that she has had “run-ins with mental health issues.” And she wanted her followers to know that they weren’t alone, as well as break the stigma for people who don’t understand. “i am normal. YOU are normal. i’m here to tell you that it is OKAY to NOT be okay. millions and MILLIONS of people are going through the same thing you are. 1 in 4 people will suffer through at least one mental disorder throughout their lifetime. (World Health Organization) you never really know what someone else is going through. be kind.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9ahpmaho2Kwra3UnaCaZZOku7it2GainqScrq6vusRmm5qtl53Bpr6MbWhramhlfXA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./liza-lapira.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Liza Lapira dating?
