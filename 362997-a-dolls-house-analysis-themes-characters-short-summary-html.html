The play was written at a time when women were voiceless in society, and Nora breaks this norm by asking for a divorce from her husband. She courageously faces her husband and tells him that they need to sit down and talk things out when she feels her marriage is not working.</p><h3>Act one</h3><p class=align-left>The play takes place on <a href=#>Christmas</a> Eve, and Torvald has just received a promotion to work in the bank. His wife, Nora, is excited about his new position, for she feels it will relieve their money problems. The couple has three young children who are being cared for by the nanny, Kristine Linde. Nora's old friend arrives at their house, having lost her husband and mother.</p><p class=align-left>Nora gets the idea that her husband can offer her friend a job, for she is jobless. She tells her friend how she had forged her father's signature to take a loan to treat her husband, and she had never told anyone about it, for women were forbidden from taking loans.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/c09299b647a70424.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Meet the real-life partners of the cast of The Walking Dead</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/056aed0e13bc2a47.jpg><p class=align-left>After she leaves, Nora's debtor, Krogstad, arrives at the door and says that he understands that Nora's husband is about to become his new boss. He confesses to forging the signature for Nora, which constitutes fraud. Nora is worried that he will let her husband know of it.</p><h3>Act two</h3><p class=align-left>Nora is talking to Mrs. Linde about Dr. Rank, an old <a href=#>family</a> friend. Torvald tells his wife that he has decided to fire Krogstad in order to hire Mrs. Linde. She knows that this will upset Krogstad, so she tries persuading her husband not to do it.</p><p class=align-left>Nora speaks to Krogstad, promising to pay off all his debt, but he declines, claiming he wants a better job. Krogstad then leaves a letter in the mailbox explaining what Nora had done. Nora then asks Mrs. Linde to talk to Krogstad about retrieving the letter. Meanwhile, Nora keeps her husband busy by asking him to help her practice dancing for the upcoming party.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/1f77107a3d2287d3.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Lisa Thorner: 5 interesting facts about Damon Wayans' ex-wife</span></p></a><h3>Act three</h3><p class=align-left>Linde then finds Krogstad, and it turns out that they had a relationship. She had to leave him for a more stable man, but since her husband is dead, she would like to get back with him. Krogstad is overjoyed, and he promises to retrieve his letter, but Kristine tells him not to because she thinks that Torvald needs to find out the secret.</p><p class=align-left>Nora's husband then joins Mrs. Linde in the office, and Dr. Rank stops by to give him a <a href=#>business</a> card. After reading the mail, Torvald runs out of his office to find out if it is true from Nora. Nora tells him that they need to sit down for a serious conversation. He then insults her, blaming her for her bad morals.</p><p class=align-left>A new letter from Krogstad then arrives, containing the contract, and says that he is letting it go. Torvald is happy, and he tears up the letter, telling Nora that he has forgiven her. Nora, however, is not interested, and she tells him that she wants to leave.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/63a99ed75b32af00.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Bryan Callen: divorce story, wife, net worth, latest updates</span></p></a><p class=align-left>She has been disappointed by how men have been treating her, and now she needs to discover who she is. Torvald then asks her if she'll leave her own children behind, but she tells him that she needs to do what is best for herself. Torvald wonders if she will ever come back to him.</p><h2>A Doll's House themes</h2><p class=align-left>What is the main theme of A Doll's House? There are several themes in the play. Here is a list of the primary themes:</p><h3>Gender bias</h3><p class=align-left>Gender bias is the main theme of the play. The voice of the woman has been suppressed by society when it comes to marriage, motherhood, and decision making. Nora is not allowed to make any major decisions, even those affecting her own happiness.</p><p class=align-left>Torvald believes that a woman is supposed to be a good wife and a mother, and he tells Nora that women are responsible for the morality of their children. Nora stays in a society where women are not allowed to take loans, and she is forced to forge her dying father's signature to get a loan to facilitate her husband's trip to Italy for treatment.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/b00559c9e22eb964.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Cody Heller: The untold story of Dan Harmon's girlfriend</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Despite all that sacrifice, Torvald still goes ahead to insult her when he learns that she took a loan to facilitate his treatment. After she has had enough, Torvald tells her that she cannot be allowed to bring up children, for he does not trust her with them.</p><p class=align-left>By the end of the scene, Nora realizes that her husband treats her like a doll in a playhouse, which makes her opt for a divorce.</p><h3>Love and marriage</h3><p class=align-left>Nora and Torvald are presented as a married couple. They use pet names to refer to each other, which shows the love that exists between them. At the end of the play, we see Mrs. Linde and Krogstad get married. Dr. Rank has never married, and he confesses the love he has always had for Nora, even though Nora is a married woman.</p><h3>Deception</h3><p class=align-left>Another important theme in the play is deception. Nora forges her dying father's signature in order to get a loan. Krogstad helps her do all these and then, later on, uses it to blackmail her. Nora never discloses this to her husband because the society does not allow women to borrow loans.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0eeff754b6ca6d82.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Yaphet Kotto: James Bond villain and Aliens actor dead at 81</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/c09299b647a70424.jpg><p class=align-left>She then shares with her friend Mrs. Linde, who advises her to tell her husband because a proper marriage is not built through deception, and true to her word, when Nora's husband learns about these, her marriage inevitably breaks. Krogstad also suffers from a bad reputation, for he helps Nora forge the documents.</p><h3>Materialism</h3><p class=align-left>Materialism is another major theme running through the play. At the beginning of the play, we see Nora admiring her sitting room, which she sees as perfectly furnished. Torvald's perception of being rich is by how much money one has.</p><p class=align-left>He refuses to take on cases that do not satisfy him, which is the reason for his success. Krogstad later tells Nora that he even wants a top position at the bank.</p><h3>Money and work</h3><p class=align-left>The need for money is a recurring theme in the play. At the beginning of the play, Torvald is promoted, and he earns a "big fat income". However, this does not deter him from chastising Nora for spending too much. He argues that they need to exercise caution when it comes to how they spend their finances.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/dd6da0dc5e693e5f.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Laverne Cox bio: transition, net worth, partner, brother, movies and TV shows</span></p></a><p class=align-left>You also see Nora being proud of the fact she raised money for her and Torvald to make a trip to Italy all by herself. However, she owes a debt that becomes a source of dread, shame, and terror. The need for money is also reflected in Mrs. Linde's story. She is in desperate need of a job following the demise of her husband.</p><h3>Individual vs. society</h3><p class=align-left>Nora and Mrs. Linde find a sense of meaning in their lives through serving others and performing the caring, obedient role that society requires of them. Throughout the play, Nora puts the needs of others before herself. She thinks little of how her act of forgery and debt to Krogstad affect her personally.</p><p class=align-left>Instead, she is worried about how they might impact the lives of her husband and children. At the end of the play, she chooses to put herself as an individual instead of what society expects of her. Mrs. Linde admits that, without a husband or any family members to care for, she feels that her life is pointless.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/db14804713fce57b.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Randy Danson: ethnicity and quick facts about Ted Danson's first wife</span></p></a><h3>Reputation</h3><p class=align-left>In the play, Nora and Dr. Rank's reputation hinges on that of their parents. The bad reputation of their parents comes back to haunt them, regardless of any goodwill they have build up on their own. In the case of Dr. Rank, his father had a reputation of enjoying physical pleasures to a damaging extent.</p><p class=align-left>Even though he is an upstanding member of society, he is punished for his father's misdeeds. In the case of Nora, Torvald tells her that she inherited her father's reputation as a careless spender.</p><h3>Sacrificial role of women in the society</h3><p class=align-left>The female characters in the play sacrifice their integrity to support their families. Mrs Linde is forced to abandon Krogstad even though she is her true love. She gets married to a richer man to support her mother and two brothers. The nanny in the story is forced to abandon her own child to work as the caretaker of Nora's children to support herself.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/7c8f0f39d42f9399.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Melissa Womer: children, Jim Carrey, net worth, latest updates</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Nora hides the fact that she took a loan from Torvald because she knows that her husband will not accept the idea that she saved his life. Despite Nora's great love for her children, she chooses to leave them and believes that the nanny will be a better mother.</p><h2>What is the irony in A Doll's House?</h2><p class=align-left>There are many instances of irony in the play. In the first act, Torvald tells his wife that they should not borrow money because it is a shameful act as there will be no freedom and beauty in their home. He does not know that the wife already has an impending loan.</p><p class=align-left>Torvald decides to fire Krogstad, for he feels physically ill when in the company of such people who forge documents. It is ironic because he stays with his wife, who also forged a signature.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/10b86ae3d517a970.jpg><p class=align-left>Nora tells Mrs. Linde that her husband is so much in love with her. This turns out to be false as she comes to learn that he is a selfish and egocentric man. He appears to be morally upright but never proves his moral uprightness. He even tells Nora that she inherited her father's bad conduct.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/f6031a717703b445.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Lisa Ramos bio: age, ethnicity, career, modelling, boyfriend</span></p></a><h2>Frequently asked questions about A Doll's House</h2><p class=align-left>There are so many questions that readers have about the themes and characters of A Doll's House. Here are answers to some of the frequently asked questions about the play.</p><h3>Which three themes are present in Ibsen's A Doll's House?</h3><p class=align-left>The three primary themes in A Doll's House are gender bias, love and marriage, and deception. Because of gender bias, the voice of the woman has been suppressed by society when it comes to marriage, motherhood, and decision making.</p><p class=align-left>The marriage theme is reflected in the life of Nora and Torvald and that Mrs. Linde and Krogstad are presented as married couples. Deception is not only shown by the main characters but even the supporting characters.</p><h3>Which themes of Henrik Ibsen's A Doll's House are reflected in this excerpt from act 1 of the play?</h3><p class=align-left>Several themes are reflected in act 1 of the play. Rebellion is one of the themes that are reflected in the act. Torvald has so much power, but the fact that Nora eats a macaroon (which is forbidden) shows that she rebels against her husband.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/dcda79253699b76f.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Joya Tillem: the untold story of Jon Favreau's wife</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The theme of love and marriage is another primary theme in act 1. Nora and Torvald enjoy playing the role of husband and wife in the scene. They use pet names to refer to each other, which shows the love that exists between them.</p><p class=align-left>With this simple analysis, you now know everything you need to know about Ibsen's A Doll's House. Do not seek further analysis.

Reading a well-written novel tantalizes the imagination, boosts your vocabulary, and broadens the horizon. Such a novel takes us away from our existence and places us in another person's skin. If you are the kind of person who loves expanding your intellect, then the novel "A Gentleman in Moscow" is a must-read.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/f077c131cd4fcc23.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Niecy Nash bio: Kids, age, spouse, wedding, awards</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Those who have read the novel before claim that they were inspired to read it more than once. It was meant to inspire the readers to press on in life regardless of the challenges that they are going through. In the novel, Count did not give up while he was under house arrest.
