drivers travelling through the Midlands but can be costly - here's how to pay the charge and how to avoid it.</p><p>Stretching 27 miles between Coleshill, <a href=#>Warwickshire</a>, and Cannock, <a href=#>Staffordshire</a>, the route is often less congested than other major highways due to the fee motorists must pay to use it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2022-bank-holiday-traffic-building-726200121.jpg><p>It was opened in 2003 to provide an alternative to the stuffed-up roads running through the heart of <a href=#>England</a>.</p><p>Prices depend on the size of your vehicle and where you pay the toll, with the option to pay from a junction or the "mainline" plaza at the beginning of the route.</p><p>Cars pay £8.90 on the mainline and £5.80 at a junction, while this is increased to £15.30 and £12.30 for vans or <a href=#>motorhomes</a>.</p><p><a href=#>Motorcycle</a> riders pay the least with fees of £4.30 and £3.30, while <a href=#>HGVs</a> top the scale at £15.90 and £13.20.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE MOTORS NEWS">READ MORE MOTORS NEWS</h2><p>And there's a fifth bracket for cars with <a href=#>trailers</a>, which are charged £12.90 or £8.70.</p><p>Paying the charge is pretty simple as all you have to do is drive to one of the lanes marked "card only" and enter your card into the reader or use <a href=#>contactless</a> payment.</p><p>Just be aware that none of the entrances to the road accept cash so you will need to make a card payment.</p><p>You can also register an account with the <a href=#>M6 Toll</a> online and prepay, allowing you to use the ANPR lanes.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Motors</h2></p><p>And those who use the road regularly can purchase a TAG device which is mounted on your dashboard and automatically takes payment from a <a href=#>direct debit</a>.</p><p>This lets you cruise through the TAG lanes without having to stop, but there is no discount and you must have a minimum of £15 credit on your account.</p><p>If there is an issue paying you can use the "call for assistance" button to connect with an operator who can take your details.</p><p>According to the road's operators, it is a "stress-busting, time-saving, <a href=#>congestion</a>-free escape route", which they claim takes an average of 25 minutes off your journey.</p><p>However, not everyone agrees it is the best option, especially as failure to pay can result in a £70 <a href=#>fine</a>.</p><p>Drivers can avoid the toll by using alternative routes by remaining on the standard M6 by keeping to the left-hand lane when the signs for the toll road first appear.</p><p>Be careful, though, as critics claim that it is easy to accidentally merge onto the toll road without realising.</p><p><a href=#>Sat nav</a> systems will likely try and get you onto the route as it is quicker, so make sure to change your settings to avoid tolls to dodge it.</p><p>You can also avoid the chance of a mishap altogether by coming off the motorway onto A-roads.</p><p>This may substantially increase the length of your journey but is completely free and lets you take the scenic route.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on The Sun">Read more on The Sun</h2><p>Overall, the M6 toll is ideal for drivers heading from the South East to the <a href=#>North West</a>, or vice versa, if they are happy to pay, but there are ways to avoid using it.</p><p>It's also important to keep in mind that, due to the lack of a link up to the M5, the route can't be used to reach the South West, which is only served by the regular M6.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqamraeiqHxzgJZsbG9sYmS1sMOMqZiyZZ1rerW7y6Vkm52jqXqzu9StnKxlkau8qrCO</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager
