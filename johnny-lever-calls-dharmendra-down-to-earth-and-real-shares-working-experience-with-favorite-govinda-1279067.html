While sharing multiple anecdotes about his life, he spoke about the daring and talented artist Dharmendra. Explaining how strong and witted he was, the Coolie No.1 actor divulged, “Dharam paji bahut daring wale hai. Jo real me hai waise he bahar bhi hai. Vo kisi se darte nhi hai. Boht achey insaan hai, both down-to-earth. Sar phira na toh vo dekhta nhi hai, vo de daalta hai kyunki vo jatt aadmi hai. Unke kissey hai. (Dharam paji is very daring.
