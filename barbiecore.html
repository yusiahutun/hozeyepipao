In this case, that's a good thing, especially since the actress is playing the iconic character in a live-action movie, set to be released in 2023. While we're pumped to see the star do her thing on screen (it's a comedy!), we may be even more excited for all the clothes. Barbiecore as a trend already seems to be bubbling up in the fashion world, and the colorful aesthetic exudes confidence and fun — something we'll happily take more of.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Warner Brothers</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_4-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A bit of history about the famous doll: Barbara Millicent Roberts made her debut on the American toy market in 1959, but the truth is, "Barbie" was never meant to be just a pretty plaything. Created by the co-founder of Mattel, Ruth Handler, the true intention was to give young girls a doll that doubled as a role model. Although Barbie was first introduced to the world wearing a black and white swimsuit, matching sunnies, gold hoops, and black pumps, it wouldn't take long for her to shed that swimwear for the over one billion looks donned across the franchise. Over 200 outfits have represented the fictitious persona's many impressive career paths, including doctors and nurses, astronauts, air force pilots, and beyond.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Still, even as Barbie added to her resumé and her look evolved (Mattel now has a much more <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>inclusive offering</a> in terms of body type), part of the draw was still the doll's bold fashion sense. In many cases, Barbie served as a child's first experience with "grown-up" style, and was the inspiration they needed to experiment with clothes outside their world of play pretend. For many designers, Barbie was a muse.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>A model walks the runway at the Moschino Spring Summer 2015 fashion show.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This was the case for CULTNAKED founder <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Mary Furtas</a>, who tells InStyle that hand-sewing Barbie clothing is what allowed her first to explore her creativity as a fashion designer. "I experimented with my first ever designs on her," says Furtas. "I think a lot of designers first grew interested in the field by doing that."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For fashion stylist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Shea Daspin</a>, Barbie was an inspirational role model. "It's easy to associate her with material objects and the color pink, but I think she represents a lot more," Daspin tells InStyle via email. "She represents ambition and female agency, and that can manifest in how someone dresses, or who they decide they want to become."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-barbiecore-in-the-early-aughts></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Barbiecore In The Early Aughts</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It's safe to say barbiecore as a fashion movement has been building even before we caught sight of Robbie stepping into the titular role. For instance, Tyra Banks took on the doll's tailored aesthetic as Eve in the 2000 <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Disney film Lifesize</a>, and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Reese Witherspoon as Elle Woods</a> in Legally Blonde circa 2001 was essentially a Barbie girl in a lawyer's world.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">We also saw many glimpses of the trend sprinkled throughout the 2010s: Nicki Minaj often sported some serious Barbie-inspired looks after her own Barbie doll hit the market in 2011 (and you'll still catch the rapper wearing <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>her signature diamond Barbie nameplate necklace</a> to this day). In 2015, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Paris Hilton donned a hot pink Barbie one-piece</a> by a pool in Ibiza, and footwear designer <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Sophia Webster collaborated with Barbie</a> on a collection of limited-edition shoes the same year. We also can't forget <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4 rel=nofollow>Gigi Hadid</a>'s shiny, millennial pink, Kreist pantsuit from 2017, which she wore with matching, pink velvet Aquazzura platforms. The look is still one of our favorites in fashion history.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Kacey Musgraves</a> also had an iconic Barbie outfit at the 2019 Met Gala: A floor-length, hot pink motorcycle dress designed by Moschino (a very Barbiecore brand!), complete with a matching hairdryer clutch, cat-eye sunglasses, chandelier teardrop diamond earrings, and shiny silver pumps from Aldo. The look was almost an exact replica of the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Barbie x Moschino doll</a>, which was being sold in the museum's gift shop at the time.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Kacey Musgraves at the Met Gala in 2019.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Women aren't the only ones honing in on the Barbiecore craze. Pete Davidson had his own Ken doll moment back in 2019m when the SNL comedian graced the cover of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Paper Magazine</a> looking very much made of plastic — and it was fantastic. Even Jay-Z hopped on the trend when he and Queen Bey dressed up as Barbie and Ken for Halloween 2016. Fast-forward to August of 2021, and Beyonce is still <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>channeling Barbie</a> — and in Versace, no less.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-barbiecore-in-2022></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Barbiecore In 2022</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Kim Culmone</a>, SVP of Design for <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Barbie</a> and Fashion Dolls, tells InStyle that, like the beloved doll, what constitutes Barbiecore is ever-evolving. "Barbie is inspired by pop culture and fashion. And like many of us, her style evolves to be reflective of today's trends and culture," she says. For 2022, as we head back to the office and regain our social lives, it's Barbie's authentic playfulness and bright, bold color palette that people are trying to inject into their daily routines.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">So, how can Barbiecore translate into your wardrobe? Well, pink does remain Barbie's go-to shade. "Pink has always been Barbie's favorite color — she even has her own signature 'Barbie Pink' Pantone shade, PMS 219," says Culmone. "For Barbie, pink represents limitless potential and is a symbol of female empowerment, which is such a perfect fit with the brand's purpose."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In a time when power dressing reigns supreme, Barbiecore encompasses all things empowered, bold, and bright, so if pink isn't your color of choice, you can stick to hues that are more "you," or experiment with other <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>statement-making shades</a> like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>orange</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>green</a>. As for specific pieces to add to your wardrobe, suits and matching sets are obvious staples, but fashion designer <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4 rel=nofollow>Betsey Johnson</a>, wants you to remember that Barbie has always been symbolic of a blank canvas, inviting people to envision their own style amidst the trends.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Especially millennial women who grew up with Barbie — specific aesthetic lines are blurred more and more every day," Johnson tells InStyle. You can mix the vacation look with the workplace look, or mix styling genres, like pretty and punk. Her advice? Shop for pieces that are "simple, sleek, and can mix and match for any occasion."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ahead, we picked out a few great Barbiecore pieces to help you get started.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57xZqqoaGfo3ykuM6tn6Kml2Svor7Bopycp6Ka</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./carin-kingsland-and-drew-fuller.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Carin Kingsland and Drew Fuller</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./food-drinks.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>What Is Cheese Tea? - The Cheese Tea Trend Has Us Scratching Our Heads</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./20-year-sentence-2003-murder-ephrata-html.html>20-year sentence for 2003 murder in Ephrata</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./3-ways-can-remove-unwanted-blog-pages-google.html>3 Ways You Can Remove Unwanted Blog Pages From Google</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./5-rewarding-benefits-of-playing-the-violin.html>5 Rewarding Benefits of Playing the Violin</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./article-fbcffa51-ae5b-5b24-ba42-7821fc682093-html.html>Child molesters are the sweetest people | Columnists</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./woman-quells-racist-row-getting-boobs-train-html.html>Woman quells racist row by getting her boobs out on train</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaX.
