Many viewers might want to know <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://stylecaster.com/lists/who-killed-danny-casolaro/>what happened to Inslaw</a>.</p><p>Casolaro was a freelance reporter who gained attention for his work on what he referred to as “The Octopus”; a term he used to describe a complex and interconnected network of individuals and organizations involved in various alleged criminal activities, including government corruption, arms trading, drug trafficking, and covert operations.</p><p>He focused particularly on exposing a supposed shadowy conspiracy that he believed controlled many global events, touching on themes such as the Iran-Contra affair, the BCCI (Bank of Credit and Commerce International) scandal, and a theory that, during the Iran hostage crisis, Iran deliberately held back American hostages to&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>help Ronald Reagan win the 1980 presidential election</a>. Inslaw was a major part of the investigation as it programmed PROMIS.</p><p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Casolaro was found dead</a>&nbsp;in a hotel room in Martinsburg, West Virginia, on August 10, 1991, under suspicious circumstances. His work and death are the subject of a gripping Netflix four-part documentary series titled&nbsp;American Conspiracy: The Octopus, which dropped on the streamer on February 28, 2024.</p><p>If you or someone you know is experiencing a mental health crisis, help is available.

The <a rel=nofollow href=# data-type=link data-id=http://www.inslawinc.com/>website</a> describes the company as “the leading vendor of case management software products in the United States for over 42 years. It&nbsp;pioneered the use of software customization tools to meet specific customer requirements without the need for conventional programming changes. It stated that the company’s case management software is “currently licensed to customers in the public and private sectors of the United States, Europe, and the Pacific Rim.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=19.98583372039><h2>Who killed Danny Casoloro?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/danny-Casalaro-.png><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Who killed Danny Casolaro</a>? To this day, Casolaro’s death has been ruled a suicide. Five months after the initial coroner’s report in 1991, Dr. Frost of the Virginia State Medical Examiner’s Office performed another autopsy and returned a second suicide verdict.</p><p>But those who knew Casolaro as well as medics who were at the scene of his death are doubtful that’s actually the case. Casolaro was on the verge of uncovering a huge government conspiracy involving many high-stakes individuals and because of this, friends were convinced he’d been killed to stay quiet. After all, Casolaro told his brother Anthony repeatedly, “If an accident happens [to me], don’t believe it.”</p><p>Don Shirley, who was a medic at the scene of Casolaro’s death, was asked by another reporter if he thought there was anything suspicious at the crime scene. “In my six years as a medic, I’ve never seen somebody cut their wrists that many times. The left arm appeared to have 8 cuts and the right arm appeared to have 4 cuts,” he said at the time, as depicted in the Netflix series.</p><p>“It just did not appear that he could have physically done this. These were deep enough that the tendon had been severed. You cut your tendon, you can’t hold something and I had the gut feeling at that time that this could be a homicide.”</p><p>However, months after Casolaro died, fellow reporter Ron Rosenbaum reflected on his relationship with Casolaro; the two had discussed the Octopus theory not long before Casolaro’s death.</p><p>“I was so skeptical about the Octopus murder theory that I even harbored a suspicion that Danny might have&nbsp;staged&nbsp;his own death. That, while his friends were saying it was murder disguised to look like suicide, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">maybe it was really a suicide</a> staged to provoke suspicion of murder,” he wrote for Vanity Fair in December 1991.</p><p>“That by killing himself and leaving enough ambiguities to raise the possibility of murder Danny would make his own death the sensational final chapter of the book he never wrote—the one thing that would validate the seriousness of the quest he was on.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=12><h2>Who is Michael Riconoscuito?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/michael-riconoscuito.png><p>Michael Riconosciuto was Casolaro’s most significant source in his investigation into Inslaw, the case that kicked off the whole Octopus theory. Inslaw is a company that developed and sold computer software for managing case information for law firms and government agencies. The controversy revolves around allegations of the theft of Inslaw’s software, called PROMIS (Prosecutor’s Management Information System), and its unauthorized distribution.</p><p>The Inslaw affair began in 1986 when the company accused the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) of stealing their software. Inslaw claimed that the DOJ had modified the software without permission and distributed it to various U.S. government agencies and foreign intelligence agencies. The modified software was allegedly used for purposes beyond its original design, including tracking intelligence and law enforcement activities.</p><p>Riconosciuto was arrested on drug charges shortly after providing Inslaw, Inc. with an affidavit in support of their lawsuit against the United States Department of Justice. He served a 30-year sentence.</p><p>In&nbsp;American Conspiracy, Riconosciuto is picked up by the filmmakers Christian Hansen and Zachary upon his release from prison and immediately, you can sense his panic. After telling them his detailed story, he expresses concern that he’d be safer in prison. Upon violating the conditions of his parole, Riconosciuto is arrested 3 days later and is behind bars once more.</p><p><strong>American Conspiracy: The Octopus Murders&nbsp;is now streaming on Netflix.</strong></p></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6KqratfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnIp6qlmadk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./will-cain-wife.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Will Cain Wife (Kathleen Cain) Age, Height, Kids, Net Worth, Ig</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./a-stocky-jon-favreau-looks-far-cry-younger-self-promotes-new-movie-chef-sxsw-festival-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jon Favreau looks a far cry from his younger self at SXSW Festival</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./20-year-sentence-2003-murder-ephrata-html.html>20-year sentence for 2003 murder in Ephrata</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./3-ways-can-remove-unwanted-blog-pages-google.html>3 Ways You Can Remove Unwanted Blog Pages From Google</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./5-rewarding-benefits-of-playing-the-violin.html>5 Rewarding Benefits of Playing the Violin</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./article-fbcffa51-ae5b-5b24-ba42-7821fc682093-html.html>Child molesters are the sweetest people | Columnists</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./woman-quells-racist-row-getting-boobs-train-html.html>Woman quells racist row by getting her boobs out on train</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaX.
