So, I don't want to be at the mercy of mandates or strike or anything like that ever again," she added, referring to <a href=#><strong>Covid-19 vaccine mandates</strong></a> in Hollywood, per Fox News Digital, in addition to the ongoing <a href=#><strong>Hollywood strike</strong></a>.</p><p>The Emmy winner -- who is best known for playing Adriana La Cerva on The Sopranos -- &nbsp;claimed her agent dropped her as a client, and said she "almost lost our home over it."</p><p>"People find that hard to believe that I was never really paid very much money for any of the jobs I've done," de Matteo shared. "People think I'm f--king made of gold, and I'm not. I’ve worked job to job. And I've turned down tons of jobs in the past just to be with my children because their dad's on the road, and he's not around as much."</p><p>The Sons of Anarchy star has voiced her support for Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who is known for being against vaccines and promoting conspiracy theories about public health. She has also spoken out against Covid-19 mandates and protocols on film and TV sets.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:bf289047-9a9d-4ec5-91e9-89844af1bb18 data-container-ref=toofab:article:d340605f-d289-4e77-9875-446a1f1b71cf data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/1a/5by4/2023/08/25/1afeb3436fd14521892b25ec61f8438c_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Instagram</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Teen Mom's Catelynn and Tyler Baltierra Talk OnlyFans Success: 'She's Pimping Me Out!' (Exclusive)</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Last month, de Matteo shared the news that she started an OnlyFans. She said she's received backlash over her decision, but "[doesn't care]" about the criticism.</p><p>"I know some people have said some nasty things about me having joined OnlyFans. But, you know, the way we see it in this house is mommy's a warrior, not accepting defeat," she &nbsp;said. "I figured, 'OK, so everybody's in their underwear and being sexy on Instagram and I don't do that, but I can do that and get paid for it.' … I don't know why I didn't think of this sooner."</p><p>de Matteo said her children -- Alabama, 15, and Waylon AKA "Blackjack," 12, -- encouraged her to join the platform in the first place.</p><p>"My kids were the ones that were like, 'Do it.' She'll [de Matteo’s daughter] edit the pictures, too, because they want certain things that we haven't been able to do," she told Fox News Digital. "I used to have a lot of money. And then, all of a sudden, I went from being allowed to work to never being allowed to work again. I was never the kind of actor that took jobs just to stay in the business. I literally took jobs to feed my family."</p><p>She added, "So, when people make nasty comments about why I would have done that, my response is, 'Damn straight, I hope you're never in the f--king position I'm in. I take care of an entire family and a lot of other people who depend on me."</p><a id=gallery-link-d1d23237-5fc6-4d96-b7d2-f734357c3c82 class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:d1d23237-5fc6-4d96-b7d2-f734357c3c82 data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:d340605f-d289-4e77-9875-446a1f1b71cf data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/b0/4by3/2023/09/13/b0f4e3e4b69443628fff0eddfbcdcc44_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7j3Jmamxfmb%2BmrYydnGalkanBpruMo6aippWZerC6y7KdmqajYq6nwMSrZKenpGKzsLjLqK6ippditbC4y7KuqKeUYr%2B2uMSsZg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./atlanta-noo-taylor.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Atlanta Noo Taylor</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./why-hailee-steinfeld-would-actually-make-the-perfect-squirrel-girl-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Why Hailee Steinfeld Would Actually Make the Perfect Squirrel Girl</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./20-year-sentence-2003-murder-ephrata-html.html>20-year sentence for 2003 murder in Ephrata</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./3-ways-can-remove-unwanted-blog-pages-google.html>3 Ways You Can Remove Unwanted Blog Pages From Google</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./5-rewarding-benefits-of-playing-the-violin.html>5 Rewarding Benefits of Playing the Violin</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./article-fbcffa51-ae5b-5b24-ba42-7821fc682093-html.html>Child molesters are the sweetest people | Columnists</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./woman-quells-racist-row-getting-boobs-train-html.html>Woman quells racist row by getting her boobs out on train</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaX.
