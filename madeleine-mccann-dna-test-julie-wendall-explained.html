She has set up an Instagram&nbsp;account claiming to be the missing girl and has shared several snaps of herself from childhood, pointing out that she has the same notable speck in her eye and freckle on her leg as Madeleine.&nbsp;</p><p id=eF6wylAB6rbW data-wc=7><strong>WATCH: Details on the Madeline McCann investigation</strong></p><p id=eMSgYfj8v1UO data-wc=55>Speaking about her suspicions, she said: "I don't remember being taken away. I mean, I don't remember almost my entire childhood… I have asked for pictures of when my mum was pregnant with me, other medical records and any pictures from my childhood and she never shows them, she just always tells me I’m crazy.</p><p id=ektl1zsXn312 data-wc=63>"My school teacher when I was very young said that I wasn’t there from the start but my parents insist I was. After all this confusion I began to do my own research I discovered what had happened to Madeleine McCann and started to piece together the similarities we shared. It has been so stressful trying to get people to listen to me."&nbsp;</p><p id=eGN-rnUwFRWg data-wc=79>She added: "First reason... I don’t remember most of my childhood but my earliest memory is very strong and It’s about holidays in a hot place where was&nbsp;a&nbsp;beach and White or very light-coloured buildings with apartments. I remember that I saw turtles on the beach it was little Bay as I can remember I saw turtles then and there were other children and they tried to touch small turtles. I don’t see my family in this memory."&nbsp;</p><p id=eiAlZUtqgnay data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Kate and Gerry McCann deny they received police letter telling them daughter Madeleine has died</a></strong></p><p id=e9seGY4kZevy data-wc=1><strong>MORE:<a class=hm-link href=#>&nbsp;Piers Morgan demands German authorities show more respect to Madeleine McCann's parents</a></strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/b403ae3178dc-madelein-mccann-little-z.jpg><p id=eBHCAQbUlK4H data-wc=5><strong>Madeleine went missing in 2007</strong></p><p id=e1qHP1xQnaaw data-wc=19>She has also said that she believes her age might be wrong, as she is 21 years old, while <a class=hm-link href=#>Madeleine would now be 19.&nbsp;</a></p><h2>Have Gerry and Kate McCann responded to Julia&nbsp;Wendall?&nbsp;</h2><p id=efBIxMih4ejP data-wc=40>Gerry and Kate have <a class=hm-link href=#>yet to give an official response to the claims</a>, though Julia&nbsp;has claimed that she has spoken to someone from the family and that she has an upcoming opportunity to speak to Madeleine’s parents - and that a DNA test will be done "soon".&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/95318d76831b-madeleine-mccann-photo-z.jpg><p id=eFmixeDWO8Y_ data-wc=9><strong>Julia&nbsp;is claiming to be the missing Madeleine McCann</strong></p><h2><strong>Update on Julia&nbsp;Wendell's DNA request</strong></h2><p id=eHIAXejlT3q5 data-wc=83>Julia is now being represented by&nbsp;Dr Fia Johansso, who shared a message on her social media channel asking for understanding. She said: "Her mental health is not okay because of a lot of haters out there, a lot of comments and a lot of nastiness. She needs help… my team and me are investigating her family, her background, where she came from and which family she belongs to and other details. We understood that this the Madeleine case would be very sensitive."&nbsp;</p><p id=e3Xu3nG0ZZkV data-wc=99><span>The accompanying caption read: "To everyone interested in Julia’s search for answers, please understand we are in the middle of an investigation. This is a vulnerable woman seeking answers about her identity and her life. Regardless of your opinions, she is a human being who deserves respect. When everything is done in the investigation in a few weeks, you can learn more, but more now, please respect this woman’s privacy. Her background was challenging and messy. There is no need to spew hatred, judgment, and especially threats towards a person in need. This is unacceptable and needs to stop."</span></p><p id=eFZbSPhL53fW data-wc=15><strong>Like this story?<a class=hm-link href=#> Sign up to our What to Watch newsletter</a> and get the heads-up on the shows and films everyone’s talking about.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfm7atuY5rZ2trYGd%2FcX2VbW9sa1%2BirqWxy56gp51dorCkrc2nZJ2mkWLBpr%2FTZqGupJmaerixzZ2YpaRdmsWxuMCipZ6cXw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./outlander-recap-season-1-episode-13-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Outlander Recap: My Cousin Jamie</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./dan-macpherson-insists-left-shirt-50-shades-grey-audition-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Dan MacPherson on getting naked for Fifty Shades Of Grey audition</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./20-year-sentence-2003-murder-ephrata-html.html>20-year sentence for 2003 murder in Ephrata</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./3-ways-can-remove-unwanted-blog-pages-google.html>3 Ways You Can Remove Unwanted Blog Pages From Google</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./5-rewarding-benefits-of-playing-the-violin.html>5 Rewarding Benefits of Playing the Violin</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./article-fbcffa51-ae5b-5b24-ba42-7821fc682093-html.html>Child molesters are the sweetest people | Columnists</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./woman-quells-racist-row-getting-boobs-train-html.html>Woman quells racist row by getting her boobs out on train</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaX.
