Here are some <a href=#>cheating captions</a> you can share during such a rough time.</p><ul><li>A question that always makes me hazy is, Is it me, or are the others crazy? Albert Einstein</li><li>Next to hurting my family, cheating on me is the worst thing someone could do. Robert Buckley</li><li>There come times when you screw up beyond salvation. This is even worse than that. You betrayed my trust and threw our good memories in the trash. Now, all that's left is resentment and a broken heart.</li><li>I thought that we would grow old together. Now, the only thing that grows is resentment. I cannot believe you had the guts to betray me like that.</li><li>Cheating in relationships is a sign of self-regulation failure. When it happens once, it is a mistake. When it happens twice, it is unfortunate. But when it happens thrice or more, it is a pattern indicating primitive, uncivilized, inhuman behaviour. Abhijit Naskar</li><li>It will always be foolish to ask a cheater if they would ever cheat on you. Dennis Adonis</li><li>Giving up on us seemed like a far-fetched scenario. No matter the rough times we were in, it always seemed like it'd work itself out one way or another. However, you gave up a long time ago.</li><li>You sincerely thought you could sneak behind my back after all this time without me noticing. I can't believe you underestimated me so much.</li><li>If someone is willing to cheat with you, they will, one fine day, cheat ON you. As much as you hate to admit it, you're not the exception to the rule.</li><li>They say that people don't change; they hide their true selves. I genuinely applaud you for hiding your true, horrible self from the only person you promised not to.</li><li>You didn't just cheat on me; you cheated on us. You didn't just break my heart; you broke our future. Steve Maraboli</li><li>What makes me wonder is how you will explain to the kids why their daddy no longer loves mommy. Even after this, I'm not sure I was the first to give up on this marriage.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/9f5bbd6c225bdf54.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>50+ sad relationship quotes that will help you deal with heartbreak</span></p></a><h2 id=545136-quotes-about-an-unfaithful-wife class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>Quotes about an unfaithful wife</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/9f5bbd6c225bdf54.png><p class=align-left>Captions for a wife who cheats are fit for hurting husbands who have been cheated on. Reading such captions will encourage them to heal and move on. Here is a list you can start with.</p><ul><li>This is the worst form of betrayal you could have done. Not only did you choose to discard my love, but you also lied about doing it. You indeed amaze me.</li><li>I may have forgiven you for what you have done, accepting it was a moment of weakness. I hope you understand that sometimes it takes one moment to ruin an entire life.</li><li>Being the only one trying in a relationship that requires 100% from both people doesn't work. Being so madly in love with you made me too blind to see behind your lies sooner.</li><li>All people have feelings; they are not there to be used. If you're no longer interested in someone, they have the right to be informed before you cheat or look elsewhere.</li><li>You don't have to have se to be a cheater. Once you start hiding text messages, lying about where you're going and who you're with, you're already on your way.</li><li>It's funny that you thought you could escape all these lies. You should have expected I'd understand the world's worst liar after praising me so much for my intelligence while we were together.</li><li>One of our oaths was always to love and trust each other, with a promise to never harm one another. But apparently, lying to me wasn't enough for you; God was next.</li><li>Breaking my heart seemed like an easy task for you. That doesn't seem strange to me; no other woman could manipulate it as you could.</li><li>I loved you with all I had, and you went out and lied to me in the worst way possible. All these years wasted following a fraud like yourself disgusts.</li><li>Marrying you was a big step I was ready to take only because I thought we had a special connection. Your betrayal was like the scissors that cut this thread we shared right in the middle.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/93602aeca8c69124.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>130+ most savage roasts that leave no chance for a comeback</span></p></a><h2 id=545136-quotes-about-dishonesty-in-a-relationship class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>Quotes about dishonesty in a relationship</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/ec4d27839eb2e499.png><p class=align-left>Quotes about betrayal and lies in marriage reflect the harsh reality that even the strongest bonds can be fractured by deceit. Dishonesty breaks <a href=#>love and trust</a>, and where there is no trust, a relationship cannot stand. Here are some quotes that will help you heal if you have been betrayed.</p><ul><li>The terrifying thing about undiscovered lies is that they can diminish us more than exposed ones. They erode our strength, our self-esteem, our very foundation. Cheryl Hughes</li><li>If you spend your time hoping someone will suffer the consequences for what they did to your heart, then you're allowing them to hurt you a second time in your mind. Shannon L. Alder</li><li>I used to advertise my loyalty, and I don't believe there is a single person I loved who I didn't eventually betray. Albert Camus</li><li>It was a mistake, you said. But the cruel thing was, it felt like the mistake was mine for trusting you. David Levithan</li><li>Confession is not betrayal. What you say or do doesn't matter; only feelings matter. If they could make me stop loving you-that would be the real betrayal. George Orwell</li><li>Stab the body, and it heals, but injure the heart, and the wound lasts a lifetime. Mineko Iwasaki</li><li>To me, the thing that is worse than death is betrayal. You see, I could conceive death, but I could not conceive betrayal. Malcolm X</li><li>Cheating and lying aren't struggles; they're reasons to break up. Patti Callahan Henry</li><li>Everyone suffers at least one bad betrayal in their lifetime. It's what unites us. The trick is not to let it destroy your trust in others when that happens. Don't let them take that from you. Sherrilyn Kenyon.</li><li>People cheat when they are afraid. When there is no cost to being wrong or confessing ignorance, there is no reason to cheat or fake comprehension. Leah Hager Cohen</li><li>For betrayal, trust must first be established. Suzanne Collins</li><li>It's hard to tell who has your back, from who has it long enough just to stab you in it. Nicole Richie</li><li>I could never hurt him enough to make his betrayal stop hurting. And it hurts in every part of my body.
