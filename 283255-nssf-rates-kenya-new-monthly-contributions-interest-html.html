The National Social <a href=#>Security</a> Funds effected this one-of-a-kind change in a move to collect more and avail more funds to its members upon retirement when they are due for payment. So, how does the contribution matrix look, and where do you fall?</p><h2>How did the new NSSF Kenya rates come to be?</h2><p class=align-left>Do you regularly check your payslip? If you are keen, you would have noticed that you have a <a href=#>mandatory deduction</a> every month labelled NSSF. And it was only a little before the new rates became effective as the employee and employer were required to submit to NSSF at least Ksh.200 monthly.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/852ebf6a4167276c.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Kenyan Newspapers Review, January 30: William Ruto-Raila Odinga Handshake in the Offing</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">NSSF contributions</a> were, for a long time, governed by the National Social Security Fund Act, Cap 258 of the laws of Kenya of 1965. The Act stated that the social security fund would only deduct Ksh.200 to be paid by the employer and the employee.</p><p class=align-left>However, some changes happened to the NSSF deduction rates on December 24, 2013, from suggested alterations to the National Social Security Fund Act. The Act also allowed voluntary contributions to the provident fund.</p><p class=align-left>However, before it took effect, the <a href=# rel=noopener>Kenya</a> Plantations & Agricultural Workers’ Union moved to court. Eventually, the concerned parties chose to sort the grey areas in the Act before making the changes active.</p><p class=align-left>In 2023, the Court of Appeal allowed the government to activate the new contribution rates, thereby allowing the implementation of the new law that raised the contributions.

Employers and employees in the Tier 1 group are meant to contribute Ksh.360 monthly, and those in Tier 2 should contribute Ksh.720.</p><p class=align-left>According to the Act, the Upper Earning Limit (UEL) is Ksh.18,000, and the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Lower Earning Limit</a> (LEL) is Ksh.6,000. NSSF contribution rates comprise 12% of employees' pensionable salaries and wages.</p><p class=align-left>NSSF monthly rates are divided into two equal parts: the employer pays 6%, and the employee pays the remaining 6%. The upper limit is increased annually until the fifth year, matching the national average earnings per the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics.</p><p class=align-left>The contributions are pertinent to the salaries and wages that fail to meet a maximum of Kshs.720 of the Lower Earning Limit will be credited to the Tier I account.
