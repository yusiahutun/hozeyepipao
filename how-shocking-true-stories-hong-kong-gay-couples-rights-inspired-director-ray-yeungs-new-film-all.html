Like they changed the locks. And they went to her apartment and they sat there for hours, giving her pressure to the extent that eventually she had to leave.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Another story he heard was of family members calling up the grief-stricken partner the day after the death of their loved one to reclaim some watches. “They used the excuse: ‘Oh, we wanted the watches for the funeral.’ Which is shocking.”</p>We meet with Yeung in a busy hotel in Berlin, where All Shall Be Well is about to premiere in the Panorama strand of the <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Berlin Film Festival</span></a>.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/02/21/8b341938-f1b2-4588-9eed-97ccf2a5e337_abc0831d.jpg>Early reviews have praised Yeung’s work, with film website IndieWire calling it “deeply moving” and comparing it favourably with the 2017 Oscar-winning transgender tale <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">A Fantastic Woman</span></a>, which also hinged on a sudden death and the impact it has on the partner left behind.Yeung’s previous film, <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Suk Suk</span></a>, known overseas as Twilight’s Kiss, dealt with a male gay couple in their fifties, but this time he wanted to switch to look at a female same-sex partnership.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I wanted to explore long-term couples in Hong Kong, same-sex couples, and how they have been treated by the families because they are out of the way,” he says.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/02/21/d420e6f3-211e-4be1-9cee-7b185c3a74ed_185b2b7d.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“In Hong Kong it’s quite interesting: long-term lesbian couples seem to be accepted by society on the surface – but accepted in a sense of ‘don’t ask, don’t tell’,” he adds.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The way Yeung sees it, “everyone pretends” – with a woman’s female partner often treated as if she’s just a friend.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“No one really publicly acknowledges them as a real couple; [they] just see them as best friends who didn’t get married.

Maybe [it has] improved a little bit, but we still have a long way to go.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/02/21/4371ef74-72a2-4540-ad4f-6ea15fdc475a_8d548d6f.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The director wants to see more done to protect those in the Hong Kong LGBTQ community.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The government has not been very proactive,” he says. “Inheritance rights should really apply to people who have been living as a couple for many years and it should be automatic rights … like cohabiting rights. Instead [same-sex couples are] having to go overseas and get married and come back and fight for their rights.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Certainly, Yeung has done a lot in the local filmmaking community to promote LGBTQ awareness, not least in running the Hong Kong Gay and Lesbian Film Festival since 2000.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/02/21/93930b08-4893-4881-aa76-487f542d9ca0_030f6ad4.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It’s easier now … but, in the first 10 years, when I was involved [in the festival], it was very difficult to find Asian LGBT movies. Now you get a lot more; the Koreans, for example, they do a lot of very good LGBT movies.”</p>Intriguingly, one of the selling points of All Shall Be Well is the fact Yeung cast Maggie Li Lin-lin to play Pat. The Chinese star was well known in the 1960s and 1970s for her work in films distributed by the Cathay Organisation, but she retired from movies 30 years ago to raise a family with her husband, actor <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">David Chiang Da-wei</span></a>.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Yeung approached Li through Chiang, who is still working today. When they finally met, she read the script and immediately responded.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Happy Together: Wong Kar-wai on his classic 1997 gay movie</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As it turns out, she has not been forgotten by the industry, Yeung says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“She said, ‘I actually have a lot of offers but everybody asks me to play a character’s mother or character’s grandmother. And I don’t have my own story. So I wasn’t really interested. But first of all, I’ve never played a lesbian before, and second, I’m an individual here. I’m not someone’s mother, or something. So for me that is very interesting.’”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Yeung held a table read when they began rehearsing, and Li’s acting style was initially a little old-fashioned for what the director wanted.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/02/21/979f922d-408a-4c8b-8517-52f1be597ef1_5d6d00a8.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“She was from that generation where everything had to be pronounced very clearly. Every word had to be very sharp. I wanted it to be very daily … so one of the things that I have to help her to do is to speak in a very lazy fashion, so the words aren’t pronounced so well.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">While Yeung acknowledges that Hong Kong audiences “of a certain generation” will be intrigued to see her return, it’s more than just stunt casting.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I think it’s important to have a character that resonates all through the movie because although she passed away in the film, everybody talks about her and what she did. So she has to linger, her ghost, throughout the film.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/02/21/71dede9b-2ab4-4d1c-b621-440f26728aa6_4c0589f6.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Casting someone recognisable who hadn’t been seen for years, he feels, was the perfect way to do this.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">All Shall Be Well shows a considerable maturity, proof of Yeung’s evolution as a filmmaker that began in earnest when he made his first feature Cut Sleeve Boys in 2006.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In 2008, he enrolled in the Columbia University School of the Arts, in New York, to study for a master’s degree in fine arts.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">‘I am by nature a girl, not a boy’: life-changing Leslie Cheung movie</span></p></a></h3>After graduating in 2013, he made his second feature, <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Front Cover</span></a>, about a gay fashion stylist and his relationship with an overseas actor.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Such are the difficulties of independent filmmaking, though, that Yeung has accepted that he’s never going to make a film every 12 months. “This took four years,” he says about All Shall Be Well.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Now, he’s got two projects on the boil: a comedy and a UK-set film that he began writing years ago when he was at Columbia.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The one thing he won’t do is programme All Shall Be Well in the next edition of the Hong Kong Gay and Lesbian Film Festival this coming September.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I’d feel very embarrassed,” he says.
