Something slightly seedy and unsettling? Perhaps. Imbued with more than a tinge of corruption and guilt? Likely. What they wouldn't expect to see would be a bright, sunlit home filled with warmth and laughter. Welcome to the home of Walton Goggins.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Goggins has more than his fair share of celebrity. In addition to his portrayal of Vendrell in , he is also known for his performances in films such as by Quentin Tarantino and by Steven Spielberg. Goggins also starred in and co-produced a short film - - in 2001. The production won an Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">His CV certainly gives you an idea of someone who has eschewed the easy path in pursuit of his creative visions. Nevertheless, Goggins is first and foremost a family man, and it shows in the way he interacts with his three-year-old son Augustus and his wife, filmmaker Nadia Conners.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The family live in a two-storey brick home that they found on a house-listing site in October 2010, when Nadia was six months pregnant with their son. Goggins calls the house "an anomaly", and it's easy to see why. The 1920s building, set in contemporary Los Angeles, features architectural elements spanning several decades that look surprisingly refreshing in a new, modern context.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"The irony is that our house was built by a man who owned the biggest lumber yard in the city of Los Angeles," Goggins says. "From the outside it feels old, very European. We wanted to honour that initial impression and continue it throughout." He adds that it was their ambition to replicate a feeling of history rather than be restricted by any design or decade.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The home is certainly not lacking in sophistication. The brick home reconciles two different styles, modern and historical. Wooden flooring, leather sofas and soft shades of brown create a gentle environment with an exquisite atmosphere of experience and history.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Each room has generously-sized windows and pronounced focal points. An abundance of natural light amplifies the airy rooms, while the enigmatic design details and palettes of deep hues add a playful touch to an otherwise conventional space. "We wanted it to feel elegant, bohemian and comfortable," he explains.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The house is a beautiful blend of luxury and vintage, and it speaks to the homeowners' globetrotting lifestyle. As a result, nothing about the interior design is generic or safe.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">There are rugs and pillows from Morocco, a framed leaf from the Bodhi tree in India, a painting from the previous owner that has hung there for 45 years, not to mention artworks and furniture from the couple's many travels to India, Cambodia, Thailand, Vietnam and Egypt. This mishmash of accessories and objets d'art was deliberately chosen to showcase the couple's personalities.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"Our home is a reflection of who we are as people. It tells the story of us - the books we read, the places we've been, and the people we've met along the way," Goggins says. "I think you build a home the same way you build a group of friends - one at a time."</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">To showcase these collectables, the actual furniture in the home is kept clean and unfussy. From oak tables and classic modern dining chairs, to a cosy fireplace and floor-to-ceiling bookshelves, it's clear that this home is a haven and source of comfort for the family.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Together, the husband-and-wife team have created a place where their mutual vision of design and composition, comfort and peace - with a touch of rustic elegance and bohemia - has manifested into a beautiful home. It's no easy feat bringing together so many different styles in one home, and it's the couples' shared interest in interior design and their easy co-operation that made the process possible.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"Both my wife and I are equally interested in interior design. Design and composition are very important to us," Goggins says. "I'm the hunter. You will find me driving up to the house with something attached to the roof or sticking out of my trunk - my wife calls it 'stagging'. She's more of our editor. She helps decide what stays." The resulting interior is an aesthetic feast for the eyes, and every piece of furniture tells a story. More importantly, it offers the busy couple a way to escape from their busy schedules.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"Our house has a feeling that I have tried creating everywhere I've lived in Los Angeles. [It's] a place to retreat," Goggins says. In contrast to their hectic lives at work, a typical day at home is spent playing, talking and reading together, and that's exactly what the actor wants.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"We moved in two weeks before our son was born - it's as if he wanted to call this place home," Goggins says. "And we're extremely fortunate to collectively call [this place] just that - our home."</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">&nbsp;</p><p>This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: Great storeys</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuqKzwLOgp52jZMC1xcueZpqqpJ6wrbGOamtub2hofnCz0Z6YrWWjqbyzsdis</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./naot-boots-for-winter-slipping.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>These Naot Boots Were Built With an Ice Pick to Prevent Slipping</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./boscia-luminizing-black-mask.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Boscia Luminizing Black Mask</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./20-year-sentence-2003-murder-ephrata-html.html>20-year sentence for 2003 murder in Ephrata</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./3-ways-can-remove-unwanted-blog-pages-google.html>3 Ways You Can Remove Unwanted Blog Pages From Google</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./5-rewarding-benefits-of-playing-the-violin.html>5 Rewarding Benefits of Playing the Violin</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./article-fbcffa51-ae5b-5b24-ba42-7821fc682093-html.html>Child molesters are the sweetest people | Columnists</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./woman-quells-racist-row-getting-boobs-train-html.html>Woman quells racist row by getting her boobs out on train</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaX.
