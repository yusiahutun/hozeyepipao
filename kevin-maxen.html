He said he doesn’t want to have to “lie” or “feel fear” about his personal life anymore. He is also the second openly gay coach in the NFL, following former 49ers assistant Katie Sowers, who came out as lesbian in 2016.</p><p>Maxen revealed his sexual orientation in an interview with Outsports on July 21, 2023, just a week before the start of the Jaguars’ training camp. He said he wanted to be vocal in support of people living how they want to live, but he also wanted to just live and not feel fear about how people will react.</p><h3>Early Life</h3><p>Maxen was born on June 15, 1995, in Houston, Texas. He is of African American and Jewish descent. He grew up playing football and other sports and developed a passion for fitness and strength training.</p><p>Kevin attended Rice University and played as a linebacker for the Division III football team. He graduated in 2017 with a degree in kinesiology.</p><h3>Kevin Maxen Career</h3><p>After college, Maxen pursued a career as a strength coach. He worked at Baylor University from 2018 to 2019, where he helped train the football team and other athletes. He then moved to Vanderbilt University in 2020, where he was an assistant strength coach for the football program.</p><p>In 2021, he joined the Jacksonville Jaguars as an associate strength coach under head coach Urban Meyer. He is responsible for designing and implementing strength and conditioning programs for the players, as well as monitoring their progress and performance.</p><p>Maxen said he loves his job and enjoys working with the Jaguars’ staff and players. He said he hopes to inspire others by being himself and doing what he loves.</p><p>“As a Black Jew who has dated both men and women, who has been a strength coach at the highest level of professional football, I’ve learned that how I look, what I believe in, and especially who I am physically or emotionally attracted to should not impact the way I or other people view my worth. And it should certainly not dictate what I feel I am capable of accomplishing.”</p><table><tbody><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Kevin Maxen Biography</h3></th></tr><tr><td width=40%>Real Name</td><td width=60%>Kevin Maxen</td></tr><tr><td>Birth Date</td><td>January 8, 1992</td></tr><tr><td>Age (as of 2023)</td><td>31 Years</td></tr><tr><td>Birth Place</td><td>Connecticut, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Strength Coach</td></tr><tr><td>College</td><td>Western Connecticut State University</td></tr><tr><td>Qualification</td><td>Graduate</td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Physical Statistics</h3></th></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>in feet inches&nbsp;<strong>– 5’ 10” – </strong>in Centimeters <strong>– 177 cm</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>in Kilograms&nbsp;<strong>– 103 kg&nbsp; –&nbsp; </strong>in Pounds&nbsp;<strong>–&nbsp; 228 lbs</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Hair Color</td><td>Dark Brown</td></tr><tr><td>Eye Color</td><td>Brown</td></tr><tr><td colspan=2><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthyspy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Kevin-Maxen-2.jpg alt width=960 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Family</h3></th></tr><tr><td>Father</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td>Mother</td><td>Heather Maxen</td></tr><tr><td>Sister</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td>Brother</td><td>Willie Maxen</td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Relationship Status</h3></th></tr><tr><td>Marital Status</td><td>In Relation</td></tr><tr><td>Affair</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Is he a Gay?</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Who is his boyfriend/partner?</td><td>Nicholas Garcia</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Personal Life</h3><p>Maxen is currently in a relationship with Nick, whom he met online in 2021.
