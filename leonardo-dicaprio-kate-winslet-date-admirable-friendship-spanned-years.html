Their bond over time has left many wondering if these two Hollywood legends ever dated.</strong></p><p>Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet’s performance in one of the best love stories ever made, “Titanic” catapulted the two Hollywood icons to superstardom in the ‘90s.</p><p>The iconic movie, in addition to mirroring one of the deadliest shipwrecks in history, set the stage for a real-time relationship between the Jack and Rose roleplayers.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>So great was their portrayal of the two lovestruck teenagers, that rumors began to swirl right after the 1997 release of the blockbuster, that the duo had a romance going between them. Their undeniable onscreen chemistry, coupled with their off-screen connection fueled those rumors even more.</p><p>Over two decades later, Winslet and DiCaprio, who first <a href=#>met</a> on the set of the ‘90s disaster film by James Cameron, have sustained their close-knit friendship despite taking different romantic paths.</p><p>This still leaves the world with the pressing question: Did Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet ever become real-life lovers?</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=A_GLIMPSE_INTO_DICAPRIO_AND_WINSLETS_RELATIONSHIP_OVER_THE_YEARS></span><strong>A GLIMPSE INTO DICAPRIO AND WINSLET’S RELATIONSHIP OVER THE YEARS</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Following their meeting on the “Titanic” set, while playing the pair of star-crossed lovers, Jack Dawson and Rose Dewitt Bukater, who fell in love in the ill-fated Titanic cruise ship in 1912, the twosome hit it off and became best of friends.</p><p>In an interview, a year after the movie hit theatres, Winslet <a href=#>admitted</a> the first time she saw the actor, she yearned for him to play the part of Jack. When her wishes did come true, her biggest fear became falling for him because of his good looks.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/new/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/20210412_225358.jpg><p>Those fears were unfounded though, as the only feelings she developed for the handsome rising star were friendship and admiration. They spent seven months in a water tank, filming the iconic movie, which further strengthened their bond, to the envy of many.</p><p><a href=#>Rumors</a> of a relationship became prevalent following their appearance together at the 1998 Golden Globes. However, when reporters quizzed them about their alleged romance, the two maintained they were simply good buddies.</p><p>The duo has since remained in each other’s lives, accompanying each other to award shows, and cheering each other on during their big moments. Reportedly, DiCaprio walked Winslet down the aisle in 2012, for her marriage to husband, Edward Abel Smith.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=DID_JACK_AND_ROSE_EVER_DATE></span><strong>DID JACK AND ROSE EVER DATE?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/new/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/20210412_225449.jpg><p>Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, despite portraying the ill-fated pair of young lovers in one of the most tragic love films ever made, never dated in real life. However, they remained close to each other’s hearts, sustaining their relationship as the closest of friends.</p><p>During an interview, Winslet once <a href=#>likened</a> a romance with her closest pal to incest, adding that their friendship only prevailed through the years because they never became romantically involved.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=EVERYTHING_WINSLET_EVER_SAID_ABOUT_DICAPRIO></span><strong>EVERYTHING WINSLET EVER SAID ABOUT DICAPRIO</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Throughout their friendship, Leonardo DiCaprio and his “Titanic” on-screen lover have shared nothing but admiration for each other.</p><p>Dishing on their relationship in a 2017 interview, Winslet confirmed how much fun they had together. She also disclosed that quoting lines from “Titanic” was common when they hangout.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/new/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/20210412_225509.jpg><p>In a previous interview, the 45-year-old sang praises of DiCaprio, describing him as a solid, loyal person and a great friend. She has also strived to reciprocate his great friendship with her show of support, calling him her closest friend in the world at the 2016 Oscars.</p><p>In another interview, the star gushed about her admiration for the Oscar-winner. Additionally, Winslet once admitted, in her 2009 Golden Globes acceptance speech, that she loved DiCaprio with all her heart, and had done so for “thirteen years,” albeit as a good friend.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=CHEERING_EACH_OTHER_ON_AT_AWARD_SHOWS></span><strong>CHEERING EACH OTHER ON AT AWARD SHOWS</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p><a href=#>Supporting each other on red carpets</a> is part of their remarkable friendship. During the 2005 SAG Awards, the duo graced the red carpets together, singing praises of each other. They also gushed about how proud they were of their accomplishments.</p><p>Again in 2009, while accepting the Golden Globes Award for Best Actress, no one cheered louder than DiCaprio, as he sat watching his best friend from the audience. In return, Winslet dedicated the better part of her acceptance speech to declaring how much she loved him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/20210412_225526.jpg><p>The “Titanic” stars were the envy of all eyes at the 2016 Oscars, where the actor snagged a win in the Best Actor category for his performance on “The Revenant.”</p><p>Although Winslet did not receive an Oscar nod that year, she showed up at the award show to cheer him on as he claimed his prize.</p><p>In a follow-up interview, the actress confirmed she graced the 2016 Oscars because she had a gut feeling it was his year. And she didn’t want to miss the big moment for the world.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=WHERE_ARE_THEY_NOW></span><strong>WHERE ARE THEY NOW?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Nearly 25 years after playing Rose on “Titanic,” Kate Winslet is now a far cry from the 21-year-old beauty, who captured the world along with Jack’s heart.</p><p>Currently married to Edward Smith, the actress was previously married twice. Her first was to actor, Jim Threapleton, and then to director, Sam Mendes. Both ended in divorce. Notably, the star is a mother of three, having welcomed a child from each marriage.</p><p>Like her personal life, the 45-year-old has kept her career <a href=#>afloat</a>, staring in several blockbusters and award-winning films. Some of her works over the years include “Revolutionary Road,” where she starred alongside Dicaprio, “The Reader,” “Mildred Pierce,” and “Steve Jobs,” earning her numerous awards.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/20210412_225424.jpg><p>Leonardo DiCaprio, on the other hand, is now 45, and has never tied the knot, but has a slew of women in his <a href=#>romantic history</a>. His career has also experienced immense success, both as an actor, and a movie producer.</p><p>He has credits in movies like “Blood Diamond,” “The Wolf Of Wall Street,” “The Revenant,” “American Psycho,” and “Once Upon A Time In Hollywood,” among others.</p><p>Amid their respective journeys through life, these former on-screen lovers have strived to uphold their friendship, even in the direst of weathers, to the disappointment of fans who still hope to see them become so much more.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kuaa7zZqpnaddmbakrc%2BroKhlm5bBpnnWoqWspJWpeqWt055kmpydnr%2BirsueZJ%2BqmZq7pb%2FHoqdmq6CWu6%2Bxw2awnpmiqHw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./why-i-left-google-maps-for-waze.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Why I Left Google Maps For Waze</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./lucy-fallon-pink-topshop-blouse.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Coronation Street's Lucy Fallon looks perfect in a pretty pink Topshop blouse</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./20-year-sentence-2003-murder-ephrata-html.html>20-year sentence for 2003 murder in Ephrata</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./3-ways-can-remove-unwanted-blog-pages-google.html>3 Ways You Can Remove Unwanted Blog Pages From Google</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./5-rewarding-benefits-of-playing-the-violin.html>5 Rewarding Benefits of Playing the Violin</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./article-fbcffa51-ae5b-5b24-ba42-7821fc682093-html.html>Child molesters are the sweetest people | Columnists</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./woman-quells-racist-row-getting-boobs-train-html.html>Woman quells racist row by getting her boobs out on train</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaX.
