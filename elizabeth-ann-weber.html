Elizabeth was first married to Jon Small, the drummer of “The Hassles,” a rock group, and also had a son. Billy was a part of that band. Jon and Billy called their relationship as best friends and also created a band named ‘Attila’. By that time Billy got infatuated and attracted towards the wife of Jon that was no other but Elizabeth and did all that was in his power to get her to himself.</p><p>According to the data available on the web, during an interview with Fred Schruers, Billy came to notice that Elizabeth was not in the groups of typical American homemakers, but she was different. He stated that she was very seductive. Perhaps that might be the reason for him losing his control over himself.</p><p>After a point of time, Jon found out about the affair of both Ann and Billy, which totally broke his heart and their band abruptly, this was the main reason for the disintegration of the band. Elizabeth for some reason left both the men in their state and disappeared for more than a week. This action of her led kicked Billy’s musical career into a deep hole, from which he became suicidal. Elizabeth from nowhere came back to him, and they got married in 1973.</p><p>Information on the web states that after the marriage of Billy and Ann, Ann requested Billy to assign her for the role of his finance manager, and from there she started managing all his business deals and contracts.

After lots of ups and downs, the couple finally filed for divorce in 1982, but during this time also Billy, with all his efforts tried his best to save this relationship from breaking.
