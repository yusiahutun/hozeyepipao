Olivia Wilde</strong></p><p>Olivia Wilde was once married to a prince! When she was just 19 years old, she tied the knot with Italian royalty and filmmaker Tao Ruspoli after reportedly meeting through a mutual friend.</p><p>The couple stayed together for eight years but ultimately called it quits.</p><p>"[I] wouldn't be this person without that first marriage, I really grew up with my first husband. Now I'm in a much wiser, more centered place in life," Olivia told <a href=#>Glamour</a>.</p><p><strong>3. Demi Moore</strong></p><p>When Demi Moore was just 17-years-old, she began dating musician Freddy Moore, who <a href=#>reportedly</a> split with his wife to be with her. The duo tied the knot in 1980 and Demi later wrote that she believed she rushed to marry Freddy because she was grieving the loss of her father.</p><p>"The night before we got married, instead of working on my vows, I was calling a guy I'd met on a movie set. I snuck out of my own bachelorette party and went to his apartment. Why did I do that? Why didn’t I go and see the man I was committing to spend the rest of my life with to express my doubts. Because I couldn't face the fact that I was getting married to distract myself from grieving the death of my father. Because I felt there was no room to question what I'd already put in motion. I couldn't get out of the marriage, but I could sabotage it," Demi wrote in "<a href=#>Inside Out</a>."</p><p>The couple split five years later, but Demi continues to use his surname.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:a942ca49-72c1-431e-bfae-1511022621b4 data-container-ref=toofab:article:ee4dbda1-eae7-4dd2-82ff-e15b8b696b9f data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/af/5by4/2020/08/31/afcc9f5f30014c82a09d634999702a8a_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Stars Who Emancipated From Their Parents As Children</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p><strong>4.

The couple stayed together for quite a few years, calling it quits in 2009.</p><p>"You know, we got married, I was 21 and she was 19, so it's like I think about that, and it's like I wasn't even thinking about getting engaged at that time or married. You don't even know anything about yourself. That's not to discredit, you know, we were in love, and it was right at the time," Dean reportedly said on an episode of "Personal Space."</p><p><strong>5. Drew Barrymore</strong></p><p>Drew Barrymore was engaged twice as a teenager.

Milla Jovovich</strong></p><p>Milla Jovovich married her "Dazed and Confused" co-star Shawn Andrews when she was just 16 years old. Milla later said the wedding was to "prove a point" to her mom, who annulled the marriage two months later.</p><p>"I was 16 and feeling emancipated, so I ran off to Vegas and got married to an actor...Basically it was to prove a point to my mum. I'd been working since I was nine, but I didn't have a bank card. I was a big girl as far as I was concerned and I wanted to establish myself as an adult, as I was working like one and being treated like one by everyone else. It wasn't about being in love, but when you're 16 you have to take three rights to make a left," Milla told <a href=#>Daily Mail</a>.</p><p><strong>7. Solange Knowles</strong></p><p>Solange Knowles and her high school sweetheart Daniel Smith got married when she was 17 years old. A year later, Solange gave birth to the couple's son and they moved to Idaho, where Daniel was attending college. By age 21, the duo had split but she says she has no regrets about the relationship.</p><p>"No, I think every decision has made me who I am today.
