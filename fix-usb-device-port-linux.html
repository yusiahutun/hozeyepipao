While the following steps are based on a USB device not being detected in Ubuntu, they should work across Linux.</p><h2 id=usb-device-not-detected-by-linux>1. USB Device Not Detected by Linux</h2><p>The first thing to check upon inserting your USB device into your Linux computer is whether it is being detected. If the USB drive is not showing up in Linux, you could troubleshoot the issue.</p><p>USB device detection is usually not as verbal or audible as it is on Windows or macOS, which means that you often need to manually check whether the device has been picked up by the operating system.</p><p>Fortunately, this is simple.</p><p>First, disconnect the USB device you're querying. Then, open a terminal window and input the "list USB" command:</p><pre><code class=hljs>lsusb</code> </pre><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/muo-ubuntu-usb-lsusb.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Make a note of the results, then connect the USB device, and run lsusb again.</p><p>This time, you should see an extra device listed, with a Bus ID, Device ID, USB ID, and a description. If you can't work out what the extra device is (you may have an internal USB device, perhaps Ethernet), try a different command.</p><pre><code class=hljs>dmesg | grep -i USB</code> </pre><p>The dmesg command will list the connected USB devices on your system. It will also include non-USB hardware and, unfortunately, offers an overwhelming amount of information. To counter this, you can try the following:</p><pre><code class=hljs>dmesg | less</code> </pre><p>Finally, you could just rely on the more user-friendly:</p><pre><code class=hljs>usb-devices</code> </pre><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/muo-ubuntu-usb-devices.png><p>This is like a cross between the dmesg and lsusb commands, listing connected USB hardware with enough information to identify them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>So, is the USB you've connected listed here? If not, then perhaps the port is damaged, or there is a problem with the device. Equally, the device may not be compatible with your OS, which may be why the USB is not detected in Linux.</p><h2 id=linux-not-recognizing-usb-how-to-check-your-usb-port>2. Linux Not Recognizing USB? How to Check Your USB Port</h2><p>If the USB is not detected in Ubuntu or other distros, it could be due to an issue with the USB port.</p><p>The best way to check this quickly is to simply use a different USB port on the same computer. If the USB hardware is now detected, then you know you have a problem with the other USB port.</p><p>If another USB port is not available, you'll need to try the USB device on another PC or laptop. This may not be ideal, however, as you may only have a Windows or macOS computer as an alternative. As you can't use some USB devices on Linux, it will be difficult to ascertain whether it is the USB device or the USB port that is causing you problems.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For the best results, where possible, stick to Linux-compatible hardware when troubleshooting USB devices. This should resolve the issue of Ubuntu or other distros not recognizing your USB pen drive.</p><h2 id=ubuntu-usb-device-not-showing-up-how-to-fix-broken-usb-hardware>3. Ubuntu USB Device Not Showing Up? How to Fix Broken USB Hardware</h2><p>If your USB drive is not showing up in Ubuntu and you suspect it is defective, you have two choices: fix or return.</p><p>A fix will typically involve checking the USB port as well as the device that is currently not working.</p><p>For peripheral devices, fixes will almost always center around the USB cable and the port on your computer. USB cables can usually be replaced, however, while ports can be repaired.</p><p>A physical check of USB equipment is a good idea. Cables should be sturdy, without any splits; the plugs should be solid, with the metal section firmly attached.</p><p>USB ports, meanwhile, should be checked with your PC switched off and disconnected from the main supply. Check if the ports are firmly seated; wobbly USB ports are an indication of hardware that is wearing out.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If the USB port is coming loose, you may be able to solder it back into place. Of course, you should already know <a href=#>the basics of soldering</a>; never attempt DIY jobs without prior experience.</p><p>Also, check for dust and dirt in your USB ports, especially those around the back of your PC, where dust regularly collects. Dust is the enemy of PCs, so it is worth keeping your system in a dust-free environment to encourage performance.</p><p>As dust can work its way into your PC via USB slots, take the time to keep these ports clean. Use a can of compressed air to disperse dust and dirt.</p><p>Can you return your USB device? If it's new, then probably. The problem is unless it is explicitly labeled as running under Linux, the retailer is unlikely to accept a return. You may need to be a little selective with the facts you share with them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=restarting-linux-to-fix-a-usb-port>4. Restarting Linux to Fix a USB Port</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/muo-linux-usb-ports-laptop.jpg><p>In some cases—such as if you're using a laptop—power issues might be affecting its ability to detect USB devices. The autosuspend setting is designed to reduce power usage on Linux laptops, but it can prove counterproductive.</p><p>So, what can you do?</p><p>First, check whether autosuspend is causing the problem. You can do this by rebooting your computer; if the USB device works, then that USB port is receiving power. The problem occurs when the power management software decides to stop sending power to the USB port.</p><p>The next step is to ensure this doesn't happen again. On Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, you can open a terminal and enter the following:</p><pre><code class=hljs>udisksctl power-off -b /dev/sdX</code> </pre><p>If you're using an older version of Ubuntu, different commands are required.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Check for the correct steps for your preferred Linux distribution.</p><h2 id=checking-usb-device-drivers-on-linux>5. Checking USB Device Drivers on Linux</h2><p>Once upon a time, USB devices didn't often work in Linux. Only devices produced by OEMs with an interest in Linux (perhaps they used it for development) would offer a Linux driver.</p><p>These days, things are very different, with most manufacturers supporting Linux. In most cases, the driver will already be available in your Linux operating system via the kernel. You shouldn't need to install any USB drivers.</p><p>If a driver is unavailable, you'll probably be able to find it by contacting the USB device manufacturer.</p><h2 id=usb-device-not-detected-in-linux-try-this>USB Device Not Detected in Linux? Try This</h2><p>For USB flash storage devices, troubleshooting is a different matter. Flash storage is prone to failure, especially if the device is dropped or used frequently.</p><p>In this case, try using the storage on a different computer; if it doesn't work, try data recovery and reformatting. Here's <a href=#>what to do if you're unable to format your USB drive in Ubuntu</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A failed USB flash storage device may be a symptom of a damaged USB port on your computer, however. For example, a bad port could be overpowering your USB drives, with unsuitable power variations damaging data. As such, it is vital that you use the steps above to rule out an issue with your PC or laptop.</p><p>Most importantly, don't rely on flash storage for data backups. While slower, mechanical hard disk drives are more reliable.</p><h2 id=troubleshooting-usb-issues-on-linux-fixed>Troubleshooting USB Issues on Linux: Fixed!</h2><p>With built-in drivers and wide support for many types of USB devices, it should be easy to diagnose issues with your computer's USB hardware.</p><p>While broken hardware may need repairing or swapping, software fixes are also available.</p><p>If you've recently swapped from Windows, running into USB issues on Linux can be a problem. Fortunately, these problems are usually easily solved.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGirmp9fm7a5edSsmWaclau2pLGMqaarrF2htq%2FB12g%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./sixthman-announces-flogging-mollys-salty-dog-cruise-soulshine-at-sea-with-michael-franti-spearhead.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Sixthman Announces Flogging Mollys Salty Dog Cruise &amp;amp; Soulshine at Sea With Michael F</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./halle-baileys-surprise-baby-announcement-shocks-fans-welcome-to-the-world-my-halo.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Halle Bailey's 'surprise' baby announcement 'shocks' fans - 'Welcome to the world my Halo'</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./20-year-sentence-2003-murder-ephrata-html.html>20-year sentence for 2003 murder in Ephrata</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./3-ways-can-remove-unwanted-blog-pages-google.html>3 Ways You Can Remove Unwanted Blog Pages From Google</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./5-rewarding-benefits-of-playing-the-violin.html>5 Rewarding Benefits of Playing the Violin</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./article-fbcffa51-ae5b-5b24-ba42-7821fc682093-html.html>Child molesters are the sweetest people | Columnists</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./woman-quells-racist-row-getting-boobs-train-html.html>Woman quells racist row by getting her boobs out on train</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaX.
