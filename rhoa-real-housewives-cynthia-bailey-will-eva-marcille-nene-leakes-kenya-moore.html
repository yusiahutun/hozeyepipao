Earlier in the evening, Cynthia had asked Will how long he had been single, to which he responded, "Like two-and-a-half years."</p><p>Kenya pulled Cynthia outside. "Listen, I don't want you to be ambushed, but they're talking about Will, and they're saying that Eva was out with him and another woman a couple months ago, and he introduced her as his girlfriend. And it was the photo of the girl that NeNe said you saw."</p><p>By this point, Eva and NeNe had joined the conversation.</p><p>"I've only met him once," Eva said. "This all happened that one night. I've never seen him before, I've never seen him after."</p><p>Cynthia was calm, cool and collected, telling the ladies, "I don't know the timeline, but I completely receive this. I receive it. And I assume that it's coming out of love and concern for me."</p><p>Will ended up coming outside, and Kenya pulled him aside to grill him about what she had just heard.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:43055200-7176-5cd6-bff3-65accec5d0e7 data-container-ref=toofab:article:461dd6f7-36f8-50b6-9c04-d69985d34241 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/d4/5by4/2018/01/12/d48e12fee25c5f34ba8d5cf868815b4d_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Kim Zolciak Finally Addresses NeNe Leakes' 'Roachgate' on 'Real Housewives of Atlanta'</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Contrary to the story Eva told, Will said he did not introduce this woman as his girlfriend and that the encounter took place seven months ago, not two.</p><p>Will and Cynthia then got a chance to talk.

Eva asked.</p><p>"I am no longer dating that woman," Will said, adding that what Eva said about the woman having been around his child was a lie. "I really wish you would have spoke to me first, and you would have had a different answer because everything was perfect with us until this came along. And I think that hurt me because the perfect gentleman that I was to her -- thank you. You showed me that I have to be more better at other things."</p><p>NeNe, Kenya and Kandi later told Bravo cams they felt Will was lying -- and that he was lying "with an attitude."</p><p>"The Real Housewives of Atlanta" airs Sundays at 8 p.m. on Bravo.</p><a id=gallery-link-fc3b9a2d-1f09-5ab3-a1ef-e6ace0a9be45 class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:fc3b9a2d-1f09-5ab3-a1ef-e6ace0a9be45 data-poster-image-ref=toofab:image-asset:image_jpg_20171005_41f2ef38dec953429e687857433e9267 data-start-at-poster data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:461dd6f7-36f8-50b6-9c04-d69985d34241 data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/41/4by3/2017/10/05/41f2ef38dec953429e687857433e9267_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class="media-credit gallery-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlfnl7j2pma3Ffp7WwrYyrnJqkXZ28tr%2FEsKCvnaNisLq606GgmmWSlratsdhmrqKknGKyt62Mppirm5mhuaZ5zZ6lnmWcmq6ssdJmop6mqZZ6rrvOq5xo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./adam-rodriguez-wife.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who Is Adam Rodriguez's Wife?
