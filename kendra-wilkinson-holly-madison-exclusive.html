"I don't miss her," she added in the book.</p><p>On the new season of <strong>"Kendra on Top,"</strong> there's talk of a potential reunion -- something Kendra doesn't think will ever happen.</p><p>"I don't know. Honestly, it's being talked about right now but it's highly unlikely," Wilkinson tells toofab of a special involving all three girls and <strong>Hugh Hefner</strong>. "There are some people onboard, [but] I don't know if everybody is onboard."</p><p>If a gathering of the gals were to happen, it'd be the first time Kendra and Holly would be in the same room since the feud began -- and the former tells us she has some big questions for her one-time costar.</p><p>"I would never be worried running into her, but I do have a couple wonders," she explains. "I guess I'd point out a couple things. I have my side, you know? I would say, look, some of the things she wrote about, she didn't actually see. She just kind of assumed. She wrote it so it would demonize me, yet I have my version of the story. It's just wrong to write about things out of my character, things that I wouldn't do, things that are not who I am. It just goes to show that, once again, we were never friends. At the end of the day, everybody has their side of the story."</p><p>"No one should believe ..." she adds, trailing off. "Whatever."</p><p>"Like Holly's situation, everyone has their perception of things and it comes from an emotional standpoint, it's coming from anger at the end of the day," she continues. "You can't believe tell-alls, you can't believe them. You can, in your mind, read a tell-all and say, 'OK, [some] things probably happened,' but this is being written out of anger or emotional reasons."</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/91/o/2016/04/06/913fff830bba5eaaafd4b831abfd3d42_md.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit image-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p>While things are clearly not kosher with one of Hef's former girlfriends, fans might be surprised to learn Kendra hasn't kept close with <strong>Bridget Marquardt</strong> either. In fact, the two recently had a quick chat for the first time in years.</p><p>"It was very quick, someone was on the phone with her and I said 'Hi,'" Kendra tells toofab. "I think in the near future, I'm gonna see her and we're gonna do something for the show. I don't have anything against her or anybody. I think it'd be kinda cool to see her again and hear how life has been for her."</p><p>Despite Kendra's warning, we're all secretly pulling for that reunion special ... and Wilkinson totally understands it. Even without the added drama of a Kendra v. Holly blowout, the E! reality show continues to be a series that holds the public's interest.</p><p>"I think what we were is still taboo and people still are intrigued by the decisions we made to live together and date the same man," Kendra muses. "It's very taboo and very intriguing and it'll forever be that way. People still try to figure it out. How does that work? We were literally the girls next door, we just made this decision to live with him and date him and I came out very appreciative and very thankful but others didn't."</p><p>You can catch Wilkinson go solo on "Kendra on Top," airing Friday nights on <strong><a href=#>WE tv</a></strong>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlfnd7j21maW5foLKvsNGaZLChnKC2r7%2FOp2Shp5yhxm65wJ2grKeeYrK5r8uuqqKulWQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./laos-criminal-casino-empire-chinese-gangsters.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Laos criminal casino empire: Chinese gangsters suspected of running brothels and online scams, an</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./iconic-foods-we-want-to-revive-alongside-lilt.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>From Taz bars to hedgehog crisps, the iconic snacks Alex James wants to revive alongside Lilt - but</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./20-year-sentence-2003-murder-ephrata-html.html>20-year sentence for 2003 murder in Ephrata</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./3-ways-can-remove-unwanted-blog-pages-google.html>3 Ways You Can Remove Unwanted Blog Pages From Google</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./5-rewarding-benefits-of-playing-the-violin.html>5 Rewarding Benefits of Playing the Violin</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./article-fbcffa51-ae5b-5b24-ba42-7821fc682093-html.html>Child molesters are the sweetest people | Columnists</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./woman-quells-racist-row-getting-boobs-train-html.html>Woman quells racist row by getting her boobs out on train</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaX.
