They prefer living by their own code versus conforming to anything society tends to think of as normal. Aquarians exhibit rebelliousness, quirkiness, a love of community and humanitarian causes, an innate comfort with platonic bonds, and a rational, if at times contrarian, outlook on life.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">These characteristics reflect themes covered by the Eleventh House of Networking, which Aquarius rules. The Eleventh House covers groups of all kinds — those you form with friends, colleagues, neighbors, and other members of your political party. It also speaks to wishes, destiny, hope, and the aspirations you'll achieve through collaboration.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you're similarly offbeat, intellectual, personable, and future-minded, you'll likely click with an Aquarian person.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ahead, Aquarius' compatibility with all&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>12 signs of the zodiac</a>.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-aquarius-and-aries--outlook-good></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Aquarius and Aries — Outlook Good</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Aquarius is sextile, or two signs apart from cardinal <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>fire sign</a>&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Aries</a>, making for a friendly, easygoing bond. Both are free-spirited, independent, and driven to achieve in their way. However, because Aquas tend to be a bit more of a people person than Aries, and Aries is often more open-minded, there's a lot they can learn from one another. The Ram person will be quick to jump on whatever massive undertaking the two dream up, while the Water Bearer can ensure follow-through.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-aquarius-and-taurus--problematic-pair></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Aquarius and Taurus — Problematic Pair</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Aquarius is square, or three signs apart from fellow fixed sign, earthy&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Taurus</a>, which makes for a challenging yet activating dynamic. Both the Water Bearer and the Bull tend to be a bit hardheaded and set on seeing the world through their own lens, which can make it tough for them to get on the same page. While Taurus, ruled by&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>pleasure-seeking Venus</a>, is a bit of a slow-paced homebody, Aquarius wants to get out and be in the world, surrounded by anyone and everyone. Still, if these two are willing to consider the other's perspective, they'll find they can accomplish anything they set out to do as a pair.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-aquarius-and-gemini--ideal-match></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Aquarius and Gemini — Ideal Match</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Aquarius is trine, or four signs apart, from mutable air sign&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Gemini</a>. This is one of the most natural pairings you can imagine, as both are humanitarian, social, and mentally charged. Still, despite sharing all that airiness with Gemini, the Water Bearer is the fixed sign of the air crew, so they do tend to dig their heels in on the way they see the world, while Gemini wants to reserve the right to switch things up at a moment's notice. Leaning into their innate tendencies to be open-minded and accepting of one another's eccentricities can keep this airy pair on the same page.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-aquarius-and-cancer--not-meant-to-be></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Aquarius and Cancer — Not Meant to Be</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Aquarius is quincunx, or five signs apart, from cardinal <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>water sign</a>&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Cancer</a>, making for an awkward, uncertain pairing. Ruled by revolutionary Uranus, airy Aquarius is aloof, cool, and future-minded, preferring to embrace rational thought over emotions. Cancer, on the other hand, is rarely going to set aside how they intuitively feel in order to use just their head. The Crab has a soft spot for traditions, especially those that are interwoven with family. The Water Bearer prefers to strike out on their own — and against convention.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-aquarius-and-leo--opposites-attract></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Aquarius and Leo — Opposites Attract</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Aquarius is opposite, or six signs apart from fixed fire sign&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Leo</a>, making for a yin-yang match. Ruled by revolutionary Uranus, airy Aquarius can be distant, chilly, progressive, and platonic-minded, while Leo exudes warmth and dreams of cinematic-level romance. The Lion also tends to be self-focused and would love to be seen as a thought leader. The contrarian Water Bearer prefers eccentricity, abhors conformity, and prioritizes community over self. Still, each has what the other could use a bit more of, so as long as both partners give and take, their relationship could be as well.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-aquarius-and-virgo--full-of-potential></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Aquarius and Virgo — Full of Potential</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Aquarius is quincunx, or five signs apart from mutable <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>earth sign</a>&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Virgo</a>, which is generally thought of as a rather awkward angle. While Aquarius is obsessed with what's happening on a universal scale and Virgo's totally in the weeds, these two can find common ground when it comes to their big, humanitarian hearts, rational mindsets, and personability. Aquarius can introduce Virgo to the nonprofit or campaign they're deeply committed to, and Virgo can devise a step-by-step action plan for making real progress.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-aquarius-and-libra--highly-compatible></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Aquarius and Libra — Highly Compatible</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Aquarius is trine, or four signs apart from cardinal air sign&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Libra</a>, which is thought of as a harmonious match. Both are super social and possess high mental energy, and they'll often come across as an influential power couple. At the same time, Libra, ruled by sweet Venus, enjoys old-fashioned romance that could strike quirky, mainstream-loathing Aquarius as boring and conventional. That said, being willing to embrace one another's passions will keep this airy pair on the same page.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-aquarius-and-scorpio--better-as-friends></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Aquarius and Scorpio — Better as Friends</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Aquarius is square, or three signs apart from fixed water sign&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Scorpio</a>, which is thought of as a tense, at worst — and activating, at best, connection. Water Bearers are notoriously friendly but aloof; future-minded but stubborn; and idealistic but contrarian. They're wired to engage with the world in a very intellectual way, while Scorpio can't help but be feeling, intuitive, and even psychically tapping into the shadow side of life. As two fixed signs, both might refuse to pivot from their go-to game plan, resulting in a stalemate.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-aquarius-and-sagittarius--ideal-pair></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Aquarius and Sagittarius — Ideal Pair</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Aquarius is sextile, or two signs apart from mutable fire sign&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Sagittarius</a>, which makes for a friendly, organic connection. The Water Bearer prioritizes humanity, community, and what's best for everyone collectively. This can be a lovely complement to Sag's adoration of the truth and soaking up knowledge and their unconventional, free-spirited path. The only spot where they might clash: Despite being so future-minded and progressive, Aquarius tends to think in a black-and-white way, while Sag likes being open-minded. If they can learn from one another, they'll be unstoppable.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-aquarius-and-capricorn--its-complicated></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Aquarius and Capricorn — It's Complicated</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Aquarius is semi-sextile, or one sign apart from&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Capricorn</a>, the cardinal earth sign, which makes for a bit of awkwardness. The Water Bearer prioritizes humanity, community, and what's best for everyone collectively. Alternatively, Cap is a bit more focused on taking on the challenges they see along their own path. Capricorn also sticks with a tried-and-true traditional approach, whereas Aquarius is about moving in an unconventional, free-spirited direction. If Cap's willing to let Aquarius show them the beauty of striking out on their own and Aquarius is open to learning about stick-to-itiveness from the Goat, they may be a dynamic duo.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-aquarius-and-aquarius--in-sync></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Aquarius and Aquarius — In Sync</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_48-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Two Aquarians are sure to be instant friends, pumped to pair up to save the world. Even if they're romantically involved, they'll feel like besties. They're both most comfortable in platonic relationships, in which they'll feel like they have enough room to breathe; they'll have no problem getting exactly that from one another. The only trouble spot could be when one Water Bearer's rational but often black-and-white way of thinking isn't in line with the others.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-aquarius-and-pisces--mismatched></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_50-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Aquarius and Pisces — Mismatched</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_51-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Aquarius is semi-sextile, or one sign apart from&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Pisces</a>, the mutable water sign, which makes for a little uneasiness. Although both are humanitarians and endlessly imaginative, the Water Bearer thinks in a very scientific, logical way, while the Fish is a dreamer through and through. However, Aquarius can learn adaptability from the Fish, while the Fish can learn to be more proactive in hitting their goals. If these two are willing to see the world through the other's lens, they could take even their wildest artistic idea and turn it into something real.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-bottom-line></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_55-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The Bottom Line</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_56-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Remember that no matter how compatible — or not — you seem to be with your partner or potential love match,&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>sun sign compatibility</a>&nbsp;is just one piece of a huge puzzle.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_58-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">You can get the most accurate idea of how you match with a partner by looking at your&nbsp;entire&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>natal chart</a>.
