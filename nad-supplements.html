Beyond being a wellness buzzword that’s currently holding the spotlight, NAD (which stands for nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) is an energy-generating co-enzyme that’s found in every cell in the body. And while the body produces it naturally, levels of NAD decline as we age – which is where supplementation comes into play.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Rewind to episode five of Keeping Up With The Kardashians and you may recall the moment when best friends Kendall Jenner and Hailey Bieber meet up to undergo NAD+ intravenous (IV) therapy. “I’m going to do NAD for the rest of my life, and I’m never going to age,” Bieber told the cameras. Hot in the US, the NAD market was valued at <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.polarismarketresearch.com/industry-analysis/nicotinamide-adenine-dinucleotide-market data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="$535.53 million in 2022" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">$535.53 million in 2022</a>, and is growing fast.</p><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for Hailey Bieber: Inside my beauty bag" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/images/hbz-imbb-hb-3-1-646739c43bf8b.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Now making waves in the UK, NAD+ (the ‘raw’ form of NAD and the most widely used term when referring to it) is taking over the self-care sphere. “Since the pandemic, UK consumers have learned the value of investing in preventative health strategies and there has been a huge increase in people actively seeking out evidence-based solutions like NAD+,” notes <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.instagram.com/drnicholaconlon/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Dr Nichola Conlon" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Dr Nichola Conlon</a>, molecular biologist and expert in healthy ageing.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">With several reported health benefits (from boosting energy to promoting healthy skin), it’s easy to see why supplementing NAD+ sounds appealing. But can it really turn back the clock? Ahead, experts answer the key questions around NAD+ and whether you’d benefit from adding NAD+ supplements (taken orally or via IV) into your wellness regime.</p><h2 data-node-id=6 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">What is NAD+?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">NAD+ is a crucial coenzyme found in our cells. It plays a major role in regulating cellular functions, neuroprotection, DNA repair and anti-ageing. “If you have high levels of NAD+, it means you will have lots of cellular energy, your cells will function optimally, and you will feel more energetic and alert,” says Conlon. It also means your body can repair itself quicker, which helps keep your organs, including your skin, in good health.</p><h2 data-node-id=8 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Do we need to supplement our NAD+ levels?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As we age, our NAD+ levels decline – halving every 20 years from birth. And as they do so energy production and cellular repair decrease, “leading to many of the common complaints associated with ageing such as wrinkles, loss of energy and brain fog,” says Conlon.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Scientists have demonstrated that boosting NAD+ back to youthful levels can rejuvenate old cells back to a state of youth, leading to multiple beneficial effects against ageing and age-related disease,” she continues. Supplements, including IV therapy, can boost NAD+ levels, and certain lifestyle changes may help slow down the decline of NAD+.</p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">How can we increase our levels of NAD+?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">While we can’t stop the natural decline of NAD+, we can help slow down the rate at which our bodies use up important NAD+ stores. “Avoid things that are known to deplete NAD+ such as a poor diet, excess alcohol, smoking and sunburn,” advises Conlon. Seek out foods that are made up of amino acids that are also precursors to NAD+, “such as broccoli and cabbage as well as some fruits,” adds <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.optimisehealth.com/product/225_consultations data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Dr Melanie Angelova" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Dr Melanie Angelova</a>, medical practitioner at Optimise Health.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In addition, exercise – especially resistance training and HIIT – has been found to ignite the body’s NAD+ production pathway. “A recent study examined metabolites in the muscle tissue from younger and older adults, finding that adults who exercised rigorously had NAD+ levels similar to those of young adults,” says Angelova.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Healthy habits aside, research suggests that supplementing NAD+ may successfully top up our levels. “NAD+ boosting in cells and animals has yielded some impressive results so now the focus has shifted to human clinical trials,” says Conlon, who adds that “notable results so far include improvements in cardiovascular function, reduced inflammation, improved cellular energy production, and reversal of biomarkers of ageing”.</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><h2 data-node-id=17 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Do NAD+ supplements actually work?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Although there are no large-scale clinical trials on humans yet, there is promising research that suggests NAD+ supplementation may have several health benefits. Below, we outline the key ones:</p><ul data-node-id=19 class="css-yzf9pi emevuu60"><li><strong>Increased alertness and energy: </strong>“One of the most notable benefits of boosting NAD+ is an improvement in both physical and mental energy,” says Conlon. “Meaning increased endurance, better cognitive function and reduced brain fog.”</li><li><strong>Improved sleep: </strong>Sleep also improves as, according to Conlon, NAD+ can help regulate your circadian rhythm which ensures you get quality restorative sleep. One <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8877443/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="2022 study" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">2022 study</a> found that after 12-weeks of supplementing NMN (one of the precursors of NAD), fatigue improved in older adults.</li><li><strong>Enhanced recovery: </strong>As well as improving physical energy, boosting NAD+ reserves has been found to aid muscle recovery after exercise. Which is why several athletes are reported to have regular NAD+ IV therapy.</li><li><strong>Hair and nail growth: </strong>Some supplement users have seen an improvement in the health of their hair and nails. “This is because when your cellular health improves, the body invests more resources into these less important areas of our biology,” explains Conlon.</li><li><strong>Collagen regeneration: </strong>If you want to boost skin health, then you need to improve your cellular health. “And this is exactly what NAD+ does,” says Conlon. “For example, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/beauty/skincare/a37526913/how-to-increase-collagen/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="collagen loss leads to wrinkles" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">collagen loss leads to wrinkles</a>, so for years people have focused on ways to replace collagen with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/beauty/skincare/a40652950/best-collagen-supplements/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="the best collagen supplements" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">the best collagen supplements</a> and creams. But we now know that the best way to increase collagen is to protect the health of our collagen producing cells (fibroblasts) – something which boosting NAD+ has been shown to do.”</li></ul><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But while the benefits appear manifold, what of any drawbacks?</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">So far, there are no reported adverse side effects of taking NAD+ supplements. But the safety of long-term use and high-dose supplementation is still under study. “NAD+ IV therapy is usually done very slowly to minimise a sensation of muscle cramping or nausea – that tends to pass in about 10 minutes,” says Angelova.<br></p><h2 data-node-id=22 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">What’s the most effective way to supplement NAD+?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">NAD+ supplementation comes in various forms – IV, injection, orally in pill or liquid form. The most popular options are NAD+ IV therapy and supplements containing NAD+ precursors. According to Angelova, “the safest way to increase NAD+ levels, as proven in clinical studies, is through intravenous (IV) administration directly with NAD+”.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Available at home via wellness providers <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.optimisehealth.com/product/125_iv-infusions data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Optimise Health" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Optimise Health</a>, a single NAD+ IV infusion will set you back £490 and the drip will take approximately 90-minutes to infuse. At the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://nadclinic.com/discover-iv-therapies/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=NADclinic class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">NADclinic</a> in London, an expert can advise you on the right IV infusion programme for you, whether it's a single IV (from £180), extended infusion programme or bespoke protocol – before safely taking you on your NAD+ treatment journey.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">For a speedier solution that’s more affordable, Conlon recommends looking for a NAD+ boosting supplement that will help restore the body’s own natural NAD+ production pathways – like her very own supplement, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.nuchido.com data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Nuchido TIME+" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Nuchido TIME+</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It's important to note that you cannot ingest ‘pure NAD+’, says Conlon. “NAD+ is an unstable molecule that is broken down in the digestive system before it can reach the bloodstream, let alone the cells where it's actually needed.” Hence why, most powders and pills contain its precursors, nicotinamide riboside (NR) or nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN). These precursors are converted into NAD+ inside the cells.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But since the beginning of this year, NMN can no longer be sold as a supplement in the US. This is because it is now under investigation as a potential new drug which will require extensive testing in humans. NMN supplements are, however, still available to shop here in the UK – though we'd recommend speaking to your doctor before adding them into your wellness regime.</p><h5 class="css-1qq1axs e1ghppmw6"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>NAD+ supplements to try<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h5><h2 data-node-id=29 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Does NAD+-based skincare actually work?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Alongside the wellness boom in NAD+ supplementation comes a beauty boom in skincare containing it. "The rationale behind increasing available NAD+ levels in the skin make so much sense," dermatologist Dr Sam Bunting tells Bazaar, "NAD+ is an integral molecule driving everything from fixing damage in our DNA to repairing our skin barrier". But can it have these effects when applied topically? "Experts think NAD+ is able to penetrate when correctly formulated, but it is quickly converted into <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/beauty/skincare/g33308126/niacinamide-skincare/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=niacinamide class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">niacinamide</a>," she explains – something which is already widely used in skincare.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">With NAD+ in skincare, it's best to look outside the box, she feels. "The part that is critical to consider is the recycling of NAD+," she explains – "it gets less efficient as we age and becomes the rate limiting step to having enough NAD+ available for all the cell’s 'housework'". Think of it as the cell’s battery going flat, the expert offers.</p><p><h2 class="css-8ytyj0 e1bddzxd0">Dr Sam's Flawless Moisturiser Intense</h2></p><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# aria-label="£32 at drsambunting.com for Dr Sam's Flawless Moisturiser Intense" data-href=https://drsambunting.com/collections/shop/products/flawless-moisturiser-intense data-product-url=https://drsambunting.com/collections/shop/products/flawless-moisturiser-intense data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=127X618962&url=https%3A%2F%2Fdrsambunting.com%2Fcollections%2Fshop%2Fproducts%2Fflawless-moisturiser-intense" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-call-to-action="£32 at drsambunting.com" data-vars-ga-media-role data-vars-ga-media-type="Single Product Embed" data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://drsambunting.com/collections/shop/products/flawless-moisturiser-intense data-vars-ga-product-id=aac473bd-47ee-48d2-a79e-5d5147dfaa6f data-vars-ga-product-price=£32.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=aefecae0-427b-4d74-bf99-2e4aa15cc071 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" class="product-image-link ebgq4gw0 e1b8bpvs0 css-15xslai e1c1bym14"><img alt="Dr Sam's Flawless Moisturiser Intense" title="Dr Sam's Flawless Moisturiser Intense" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vader-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/1700651479-screenshot-2023-11-22-at-11-10-25-655de1a5633ee.png width=548 height=906 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><h2 class="css-8ytyj0 e1bddzxd0">Dr Sam's Flawless Moisturiser Intense</h2></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Ergo, Dr Bunting formulated her new Flawless Moisturiser Intense with the innovatibe ingredient Sunflower Shoot Extract (SSE), which has the ability to boost NAD+ levels. "In our independent study, SSE outperformed niacinamide by acting very quickly (within just 24 hours) and resulting in 34 per cent less damage to the cell batteries when exposed to damaging UVA," she says. That’s not to say niacinamide doesn’t perform too; it just highlights a different way of working.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=34 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The other thing she notes as exciting about boosting NAD+ levels via skincare is how much better all your products with actives ingredients (such as <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/beauty/skincare/a31278199/best-retinol-cream/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=retinoids class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">retinoids</a> and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/beauty/skincare/g28408756/best-vitamin-c-serums/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="vitamin C" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">vitamin C</a>) can perform when your skin cells are fully charged.
