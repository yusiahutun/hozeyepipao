I was in touch with a lady at home who helps me, who said that the Queen wasn't very well and that doctors had been called.</p><p id=earOBlxVn-H5 data-wc=40>"Then about an hour later she phoned and told me the Queen had died.

She was special. It was quite an honour.</p><p id=eJ3_GNcMUtYt data-wc=25>"The Queen first began wearing our gloves in the 1940s when my mother started the business, and she stayed loyal to the brand ever since."</p><p id=ebJvSIJbC0oR data-wc=1><strong>MORE:</strong>&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>The Queen's glove maker reveals why her Majesty always wears the chic accessory</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/0fef7e88384c-genevieve-james-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=e-OJaL_YJ-1D data-wc=7><strong>Genevieve James of Cornelia James glove makers</strong></p><p id=eoSWseGeMTHP data-wc=33>"I always remember that when my mother was dying (my mother had cancer and was in a hospice), the palace rang up and said the Queen wanted to know how my mother was.</p><p id=eyXBMDVLdZQC data-wc=38>"I thought that was really quite thoughtful.

That's the sort of knack that she had. She was so much a people's person. When you talked to her, she made you feel like you were the only that counted.

My mother was a very modest lady. When she got given a Royal Warrant in 1979, she was speechless. I think she would be so sad at the Queen's death, but also so honoured to have been a very small part in the history of this wonderful woman."</p><p id=ekLtavdj4MHx data-wc=22></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
