Type “bioresonance” into a search engine, though, and the results run the gamut from miracle claims to quackery. <span class="c1 css-1mniedq eq9i9439" data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-1>What is this alternative therapy and does it work?</span></p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">To understand the premise of bioresonance, consider basic physics and Einstein’s finding that “matter is energy, whose vibration has been so lowered as to be perceptible to the senses” and his conclusion that “everything in life is vibrating”. Each of our cells, organs, tissues and systems emits its own electromagnetic wave that resonates at a specific frequency pattern, and is considered “harmonious” when it is functioning at its best.</p>Viruses, bacteria, <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">stress</span></a>, toxins and inflammation cause the cells to resonate at different frequency patterns, leading to “disharmonious” frequencies. A bioresonance machine tests for imbalances, picks up the “disharmonious” frequencies and neutralises them.Proponents say the treatment is effective for anxiety and chronic stress, chronic back and <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">arthritic pain</span></a>, asthma and other allergies, gastrointestinal complaints, skin conditions, and <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">food intolerances</span></a>.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">While some scientific studies show positive effects from bioresonance, these studies include only a small number of people and the research has been limited.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2020/07/02/0847eaa2-bb58-11ea-b64b-070a892763db_972x_130314.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">To experience it myself, I had treatments at iLiving and LifeHub, two wellness centres in Hong Kong’s Central district. Both use a machine made by German brand Rayonex. Although the centres have different approaches, the premise is the same. Both stressed that a bioresonance consultation is not intended to replace a medical health check, but to allow clients to proactively monitor their health.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">iLiving advised me to wear clothing made from natural fibres such as cotton, wool or linen. The session was done in a private room. After removing my jewellery and putting my phone onto “flight mode”, I lay on a reclining chair on a special “modulation mat” which I was told could detect my body’s frequencies and transfer harmonising frequencies.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">You should really consider taking these five supplements</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">ECG (electrocardiogram) pads were attached to my wrists and ankles and connected to the machine. Then, for about 15 minutes, it ran through 200 frequencies my body emitted to generate a report.</p>Interestingly, the top three imbalances noted were related to recent, non-urgent health issues. I had recently recovered from a bad cough (this was pre-<a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">coronavirus</span></a>) and a slight inflammation around my lungs was flagged up.Then the therapist tested me against a range of foods to determine which worked well with my body and which didn’t, and also tested some <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">supplements</span></a> I take regularly. The ones my doctor had prescribed were deemed in harmony with my body, while those that I’d self-prescribed for the most part were not.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Some people come with a bag of supplements … and discover that half of them don’t work for them, so they save money down the road,” says iLiving founder Anita Cheung.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2020/07/02/2804de66-bb55-11ea-b64b-070a892763db_972x_130314.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Cheung says people often discover intolerances to food types such as nightshades, which include tomatoes, aubergines and peppers.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Sometimes people don’t realise that if they are intolerant [to nightshades] it can worsen inflammation in conditions such as arthritis,” says Cheung.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The report is clearly stamped: “This is not a medical report and is not intended to be diagnostic. It is not to be replaced with medical testing or used for medical interpretation.” It is intended to be used as an alert. If something looks alarming, you can check it out with your GP. Sometimes bioresonance picks up weaknesses in the body that haven’t yet manifested with physical symptoms, so it’s a chance to catch issues early. It’s also a tool to guide you in reviewing your diet and overall health.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2020/07/02/f22b586c-bb7f-11ea-b64b-070a892763db_972x_130314.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">I had only one 30-minute harmonisation treatment, so can’t attest to the treatment’s efficacy – apparently you need three to six sessions to feel the effects. I did sleep well that night and woke up feeling more refreshed than usual. I also spoke to people who use it regularly.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lakshmi Harilela tried bioresonance a year ago for skin issues and an ongoing infection. She didn’t tell the therapist about her health complaint and when the machine accurately picked up her body’s weaknesses she committed to several sessions.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I don’t usually believe in this hocus-pocus stuff, but I thought I’d give it a try and found it was really accurate – within three sessions my symptoms had cleared,” says Harilela.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2020/07/02/f328c11e-bb7f-11ea-b64b-070a892763db_972x_130314.jpg>Carmen Cheng says she used bioresonance to improve her diet, determining which foods supported her body and which didn’t. She had been aware of a <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">dairy intolerance</span></a>, but a banana intolerance was a surprise.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I found the food testing really fun, it was mind opening. Also, I used to buy a lot of supplements … and used the machine to work out which ones were effective for me, so it has helped me save money because I’m not spending on supplements I don’t need,” she says.</p>At LifeHub, the bioresonance is done on the first floor of the three-floor wellness and medical centre. The machine is in an open area so people can come with a friend and chat, and clients are encouraged to combine it with another treatment, such as an IV drip or <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">oxygen therapy</span></a>.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We use the machine more as a preliminary scan,” says LifeHub co-founder Candice Chan. “If it points to a health issue, such as a thyroid or gut issue, we ask about symptoms and then do a lab test upstairs if necessary. We combine bioresonance with functional medicine.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2020/07/02/07fbd748-bb80-11ea-b64b-070a892763db_972x_130314.jpg>She says the clinic has seen good results using bioresonance on clients with chronic inflammation, <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">eczema</span></a>, <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">allergies</span></a>, ADHD (attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder) and autism.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Often with autism we also see very high heavy metals or a lack of certain minerals and then use the machine to detox,” says Chan.</p>If you are seriously ill – or believe you have a medical condition – then you need to discuss it with your GP. If you are looking for an <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">alternative treatment</span></a> to do alongside traditional medicine, bioresonance is non-invasive and won’t interfere with other treatments.
