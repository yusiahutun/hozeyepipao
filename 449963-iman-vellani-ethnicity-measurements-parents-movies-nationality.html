She grew up in Ontario, where she experienced her childhood. Iman Vellani's father and mother immigrated to Canada from Pakistan. They are Ismaili Muslims, thus making Iman’s religion a Muslim.</p><p class=align-left>Since her parents are Ismaili Muslims, Vellani identifies with the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Shia branch of Islam</a>. Apart from her religion, Vellani’s ethnicity is Pakistani. While growing up in Markham, Iman Vellani attended Unionville High School, a public high school of the York Region District School Board in Ontario, Canada.</p><p class=align-left>She graduated and joined the acting profession. In 2019, the Toronto International Film Festival Next Wave Committee selected her as a member at the 2019 TIFF.</p><h2>Professional career</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/46dd998da8175106.png><p class=align-left>Iman Vellani started her professional career in 2019. She has been in the entertainment scene for only three years. Thus, she is still building her portfolio as an actress. However, in 2019, Vellani was part of the Next Wave Committee at the<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> Toronto Film Festival</a>.</p><p class=align-left>Part of her work was to add a special tag to films that the committee believed would impact peers. Furthermore, the committee’s members highlighted under-represented voices and stories universal to young people. Iman was 17 and a grade 12 student in Markham when she was part of the Committee.</p><h3>First film</h3><p class=align-left>Before she became an <a href=#>actress,</a> Iman Vellani was more interested in cinematography.

Kamala Khan is a superhero who has appeared in many of Marvel’s comic <a href=#>books</a>.
