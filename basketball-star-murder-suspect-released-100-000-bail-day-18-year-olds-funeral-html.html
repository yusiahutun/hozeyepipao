state university</p><p>The murder suspect of a star university basketball player has been released on a $100,000 bail.</p><p>Shanterrica Madden, 18, is accused of killing her roommate, Tina Stewart, after she was found with several stab wounds in the apartment they shared in Murfreesboro, Tennessee.</p><p>She had been initially refused bail, but today a judge overturned the original decision.<br></p><p>The funeral of the 21-year-old Middle Tennessee State University Lady Raiders basketball player is set for tomorrow.</p><p>The Rutherford County General Sessions Court hearing was postponed until March 24, but the defence and prosecution agreed to a $100,000 bail.<br></p><p>District Attorney General Bill Whitesell said that he understood Miss Stewart's funeral was scheduled for Saturday in Memphis and that the family had scheduled visitation for Friday.</p><p>He said he expected Stewart's family would like to be at the preliminary hearing, adding: ‘We certainly want to give them that opportunity.’</p><p>Madden’s parents spoke out for the first time since the arrest, claiming their daughter is a family person, a great kid and a good student.</p><p>Her mother said: ‘She is focused on life. She knows what she wants out of life.’</p><p>Defense attorney Joe Brandon Jr. has said his client acted in self-defence.</p><p>Her father, Frank Madden, defended his daughter as someone who has never been a problem and said she planned to become an attorney.</p><p>He said the family wants to sit down with their pastor and Miss Stewart's parents to talk soon.</p><p>‘That's what we need. We all lost something.’</p><p>The alleged incident which happened on March 2, shocked the university.</p><p>In a statement posted on the school's website, President Sidney McPhee said: ''The anguish I feel as a father and a president ... but personally as a father with a daughter about the age of Tina cannot adequately be expressed.'</p><p>'Our hearts are heavy with grief and our thoughts and prayers are with her and her family.'</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/03/12/article-0-0D756A6F000005DC-986_224x401.jpg height=401 width=224 alt="Clantina Marie Lapae Stewart playing basketball for Middle tennessee state university" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/03/12/article-0-0D756AA3000005DC-363_224x401.jpg height=401 width=224 alt="Shanterrica Madden" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Roommates: Tina Stewart, left, was found with stab wounds in the apartment she shared with Shanterrica Madden, right.

She would light up a room. It's hard to describe, it's hard for me to find words. I wish you all could have got to know her.</p><p>'This is an unspeakable tragedy to one of our family members.
