So when we set out to find the <a href=# rel=noopener>best romantic comedies</a> of all time, there were dozens of beloved rom-coms to choose from. From Meg Ryan classics like Sleepless in Seattle and When Harry Met Sally to newer flicks like Crazy Rich Asians and Palm Springs, rom-coms have been around for decades (or even centuries, according to some experts who consider Shakespeare plays some of the best romantic comedies), so to come up with our own list of the best romantic comedies was no easy feat.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/kentucky-derby-2.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/buffing-bar.jpg><p>But what makes a rom-com? Well, it’s more than a funny romance movie or a comedy film with love. (Though, of course, those are necessary ingredients to the <a rel=noopener href=#>best romantic comedies</a>.) For the most part, rom-coms have a “meet cute” where the leads meet in an unconventional way. (Take You’ve Got Mail, for example, where Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks’ characters meet online, unaware that they hate each other in real life.) Of course, not all of the <a rel=noopener href=#>best romantic comedies</a> start with the meet-cute. (Crazy Rich Asians is a good example of a rom-com that starts in the middle of a serious relationship.) But for the most part, meet-cutes—as well as the grand finale kiss—are expectations that viewers have of the <a rel=noopener href=#>best romantic comedies</a>.</p><p>So if you’re in the mood for some love and laughs, check out our list of the <a rel=noopener href=#>best romantic comedies</a> ahead and embark on your next rom-com binge.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=the-best-rom-coms-of-all-time>The best rom-coms of all time</h2><p>Here are the best romantic comedy <a href=# id=auto-tag_movies data-tag=movies>movies</a>… according to us, anyway!</p><p>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.

Little does Rachel know, her boyfriend, Nick Young, is a member of one of the wealthiest families in Singapore and has a mother who disapproves of almost anyone he dates, especially an American.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51pcCbzCqUL._SL500_.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=27-dresses-2008><span class=s1>27 Dresses (2008)</span></h2><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p>27 Dresses stars Katherine Heigl as Jane, a woman who’s been the maid-of-honor in 27 weddings but has never been a bride herself.

The film stars Kate Hudson as a women’s magazine writer named Andie who is assigned a story to write about how she can make a man break up with her in 10 days or less. On the flip side, the man she’s trying to woo and un-woo, Benjamin, makes a bet with his friends that he can make a woman tell him she loves him in the same amount of time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41Bx96vYtfL._SL500_.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=when-harry-met-sally-1989><span class=s1>When Harry Met Sally (1989)</span></h2><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p>When we think of the best romantic comedies, When Harry Met Sally always comes to mind. The film stars Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal as two people who meet via chance encounters for 12 years. The film, which is remembered for the iconic Katz Deli orgasm scene, raises the question if men and women can ever just be friends.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51BnoUUkZIL._SL500_.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=sleepless-in-seattle-1993><span class=s1>Sleepless in Seattle (1993)</span></h2><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p>Meg Ryan ruled the ’90s rom-coms, so it’s no surprise that three of her movies are on this list of the best romantic comedies. Sleepless in Seattle stars Tom Hanks as Sam, a single father to an 8-year-old son who lost his wife to cancer. One day, Sam’s son calls a local radio station and persuades his father to tell his story on the radio. The story wins over the hearts of hundreds of listeners, including Annie (Ryan), who decides whether or not to reach out to him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41-Ek-xUY-L._SL500_.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=you-ve-got-mail-1998><span class=s1>You’ve Got Mail (1998)</span></h2><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p>After Sleepless in Seattle, Hanks and Ryan returned with another best romantic comedy, You’ve Got Mail. The film stars Hanks as Joe, the executive of a mega bookstore chain that tries to run out an independent bookstore owned by Kathleen (Ryan.) The two hate each other in real life, but unbeknownst to them, they’ve been chatting anonymously with each other online and starting to develop feelings for one another. You can only imagine what happens when they meet each other in real life.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41YHVctELPL._SL500_.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=how-stella-got-her-groove-back-1998><span class=s1>How Stella Got Her Groove Back (1998)</span></h2><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p>How Stella Got Her Groove Back, based on Terry McMillan’s novel of the same title, stars Angela Basset as Stella, a 40-year-old stockbroker, who’s persuaded to go on a vacation to Jamaica with her best friend.
