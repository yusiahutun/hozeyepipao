Although the&nbsp;affair may have been for longtime or&nbsp;short-term, it was not made public as to whether their relationship eventually ended or not. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-607 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In an interview&nbsp;with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">thedailybeast.com</a>&nbsp;in October&nbsp;2015,&nbsp; Emily opened up about her previous relationship with Jimmy stating,</p><p>It’s the greatest accomplishment of my life, preserving that. I feel that was the hardest thing I’ve ever had to do, was to separate the two things—finding what love is and knowing that you have a love that’s a lifelong love and managing to shape it without losing it. That was really hard when it first happened and took years to find its shape. It’s really emotional to talk about.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>However, they are a good companion&nbsp;composing music together in a band, Metric at present. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-608 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>Moreover,&nbsp;Emily was once linked with&nbsp;Philip Kurt Kressin, the singer and songwriter of the Indie Rock band, Neon Legion.

She is not married to her husband or spotted dating with a boyfriend at present.<span style=color:red>&nbsp;</span>Besides, she may be single focusing on her musical career or&nbsp;she might also be secretly dating with her&nbsp;boyfriend.</p><h2>Emily Haines Metric, Career In Music</h2><p>Emily Haines, born on 25 January&nbsp;1984 in New Delhi, India is originally named Emily Savitri Haines.
