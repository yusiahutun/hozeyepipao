By adding subtle definition and framing the eyes beautifully, the soft angled eyebrow shape helps to balance the features of an oval face.</p><p>Remember, when deciding on the thickness and height of your soft-angled eyebrows, it's important to consider your personal style, face shape, and the overall effect you want to achieve.

The beginning should align with the inner corner of the eye, while the arch should be positioned slightly above the pupil. Finally, the end of the brow should extend past the outer corner of the eye.</li><li>When shaping the brows, begin by using a lighter shade of brow pencil or a brush to outline the desired shape. Start by creating a straight line that gradually curves around the top and bottom of the eyebrows, maintaining a soft and subtle curve.</li><li>Ensure that the strokes are light and feathery to achieve a natural appearance. Alternatively, a brush can be used to soften any sharp edges, resulting in a softer and more effortless brow look.</li><li>The soft angled eyebrow shape has the advantage of making your face appear longer, especially if you have a roundish oval face shape. The curves and angles of this style work harmoniously with the balanced proportions of an oval face.</li><li>For added convenience and precision, consider using eyebrow stencils.
