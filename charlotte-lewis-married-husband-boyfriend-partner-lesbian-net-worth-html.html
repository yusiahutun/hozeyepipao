But&nbsp;did the incident hurt Charlotte to the extent that she could not have a long lasting relationship? Or is she in a dating or married relationship? Stick around to find out!</p><h2>A Secret Husband Or A Partner?</h2><p>The gorgeous Charlotte Lewis has been involved in <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">multiple relationships</a>, but couldn’t walk down the aisle with any of her partners.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-182 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span>If you go through Lewis’ dating history, you will come across different names like Roman Polanski (1984), Charlie Sheen (1986 - 1988), Mario Sotela (1988 - 1989), William Annesley (1991 - 1993), Eric Clapton (1996), and Jim Carrey (1999).</p><p>But among all her&nbsp;affairs, her abusive relationship with Roman Polanski&nbsp;grabbed the most attention. In May 2010, the British actress Lewis <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">revealed</a> that Polanski abused her when she was sixteen. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-180 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>She affirmed that Polanski, who enjoys the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">net worth</a> of $45 million (now), invited her to spend a night at his apartment in Paris when she was auditioning for a character in the movie "Pirates" in 1983 in Paris.</p><p></p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-181 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><strong>Caption: Charlotte Lewis pictured with Roman Polanski in Cannes in the year 1986.</strong></p><p>Photo Credit: Daily Mail</p><p>Moreover, Charlotte explained how she became the victim of Polanski's abuse and said, <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-183 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>“He sexually abused me and manipulated me in the worst way. He forced himself upon me. He took advantage of me and I have lived with the effects of his behaviour ever since. He has scarred me.”</p><p>Furthermore, Charlotte added,</p><p>“He just said very coldly, “If you’re not a big enough girl to have sex with me, you’re not big enough to do the screen test. I must sleep with every actress that I work with, that’s how I get to know them, how I mould them.”</p><p>In <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">an interview</a> with Daily Mail in January 2017, she explained that she didn’t go to the authorities because she was scared and ashamed.&nbsp;</p><p>Lewis stated that he has put a strain on her life and will not forget him for what he has done with her.</p><p>“I was recently engaged to a lovely man, but I would often clam up physically and I don’t think I’m very good in relationships. I will never forgive Polanski for what he has done to me.”</p><p>With a tearful&nbsp;eye, Charlotte said that justice needs to be served, as she is telling the truth.</p><p>‘I will never forgive Polanski. ‘I’ll never know if my life would have been different had this not happened. There needs to be some justice. I’m telling the truth and Roman knows I’m telling the truth.’</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-185 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span>In the case against Roman&nbsp;Polanski lawyer,&nbsp;Gloria Allred represented the case. After the interview with Lewis in January 2017, Daily Mail contacted Roman for the comment, but he declined.</p><p>Lewis hasn’t opened up about her relationship, but according to her confession, she is engaged to a lovely man. However, she has not disclosed his identity yet. But the question arises will the lovely man turn into her husband? Only time will tell, as she may take some time before getting married.</p><p>You might not know that Lewis was once believed to be lesbian after she <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">claimed</a> that she shared a night of lesbian love with Elizabeth Hurley. She said that they made love to please Lewis' then boyfriend, William Annesley.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-631 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>"I only did it to please him because I'm not gay and neither is Elizabeth. We just went through the motions. I think she probably did it for William's sake as well, because she had the big hots for him."</p><p>Do you know that Lewis has a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">son born</a> in 2004? Well, she hasn’t opened up more about her son along&nbsp;with his name and the details of his father.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-186 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span>Surprised?&nbsp;</p><p><a href=# rel=follow>Stay with us</a> to remain updated with Charlotte Lewis!</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikmauys63MqaypZpOkunCxza2cq6yRnruusc2tZpygkae5sMDTnmSlnaeewG65wKupop2UYrW2v8GapZ1lkqTGp77InqWdZaCWv7W6xKtkpZ2jl7aiuoynnK1lp6S%2FtbSNoaumpA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./recipes.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Hanukah smitten kitchen</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./wowcher-mystery-holidays-99-back-32135296.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Wowcher mystery holidays for 99 are back including Dubai, New York and the Maldives</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./20-year-sentence-2003-murder-ephrata-html.html>20-year sentence for 2003 murder in Ephrata</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./3-ways-can-remove-unwanted-blog-pages-google.html>3 Ways You Can Remove Unwanted Blog Pages From Google</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./5-rewarding-benefits-of-playing-the-violin.html>5 Rewarding Benefits of Playing the Violin</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./article-fbcffa51-ae5b-5b24-ba42-7821fc682093-html.html>Child molesters are the sweetest people | Columnists</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./woman-quells-racist-row-getting-boobs-train-html.html>Woman quells racist row by getting her boobs out on train</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaX.
