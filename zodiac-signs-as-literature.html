R. Martin once said “A reader lives a thousand lives before he dies.

Astrology can bring meaning to the seemingly innocuous coincidences of our lives, proving that our lives are just as interesting as those lived by the characters in our favorite books. And by analyzing the literature that best represents our astrological makeup, we can learn <a href=#>how to better understand ourselves</a>. Without further ado, here’s the classic novel <a href=#>that captures each zodiac sign</a>:</p><h2>The Classic Literature That Captures Each Zodiac Sign</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/9780143129400.jpeg><h2>Lord of the Flies by William Golding</h2><p>Lord of the Flies is a story about what happens when humans—namely children—are left to their own devices. When you remove society from the equation, anything can happen. And when rules, guidance, adult supervision and societal structures are no longer in place, people can descend into animalistic behavior, which is exactly what happens to a group of young British boys when they find themselves stranded on a uninhabited island. In astrology, Aries is ruled by Mars—planet of conflict, combat and primal instinct—which makes Lord of the Flies the perfect literary representation for this feisty and chaotic fire sign.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/the-great-gatsby-9781982146702_xlg.jpeg><h2>The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald</h2><p>Between the decadent parties of the roaring 20’s and the mysterious beauty of the Jazz Age, The Great Gatsby is a Taurus vibe from start to finish. Ruled by Venus—planet of love and pleasure—Taurus is a zodiac sign that craves luxury and longs for romantic stability. Enter Jay Gatsby, a man who spends his whole life working toward making his fortune and impressing the woman he’s always wanted. However, behind the curtain of Gatsby’s all-night soirées sits a lonely man, evoking the Taurus tragedy of a society that places more value in one’s things than one’s heart.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/817FVuVPWoL.jpeg><h2>The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde</h2><p>There are always two sides to a Gemini’s personality. And when it comes to Dorian Gray, those two personalities look nothing like each other at all. The protagonist of Oscar Wilde’s best-known literary work begins as a beautiful and impressionable young man who pledges his soul to a painting of himself. And as the years go by, Dorian’s youth remains undisturbed, but his portrait reflects his aging and absorbs his bad karma. To the rest of the world, Dorian appears irresistible, but little do they know his portrait continues to wither and decay. The way this story explores the gray area of the human soul is incredibly Gemini. Plus, the unspoken queer undertones only emphasizes the clever energy of this curious air sign.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/GUEST_8f7356bf-10b0-42d4-b337-57e49d561fba.jpeg><h2>Little Women by Louisa May Alcott</h2><p>The March sisters are characters that we return to over and over again. And like every nostalgic Cancer, Little Women continues to be a book that we never get tired of re-reading. But that’s not the only reason this heart-warming American novel radiates cozy and compassionate Cancer energy. This water sign is famous for being a homebody and a caretaker. And at the heart and soul of Little Women is a family that loves each other. And the dramatic ups and downs between Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy March remind us that while we sometimes can’t stand the people we’re related to, our love for them will always win in the end.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/09423_1_ftc_dp.jpeg><h2>The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe by C.S. Lewis</h2><p>In astrology, Leo is associated with the “inner child”; the part of us that never truly ages into adulthood. And in The Chronicles of Narnia, we are transported back to a time of wonder, fantasy and endless daydreams. Not only is the Leo symbolism obvious from the jump—hello, Aslan is literally a lion—but the story reminds you of a time where it definitely seemed possible to enter a different dimension through a magical portal in your own home. The Narnia universe has kings, queens, creatures and fairytales, which is more than enough to keep a Leo interested in turning the page.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/910oVuxR8lS.jpeg><h2>Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen</h2><p>“It’s a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.” Once you’ve finished reading the legendary first line of Pride and Prejudice, you know you’re gearing up for a very Virgo reading experience. Set in the graceful and formal Regency period, this novel is all about navigating seemingly arbitrary etiquette rules and learning how to see someone beyond their class rank. Between the many layers of social politics and clever wordplay, what Virgo wouldn’t be hooked on this timeless story? Plus, the subtle and unspoken sexual tension of Mr. Darcy’s hand grazing against Elizabeth Bennet’s is makes for a love story that’s Virgo to its very core.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screen-Shot-2022-12-06-at-9.16.01-PM.png><h2>To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee</h2><p>Libra is one of the most courageous and compelling signs in all the zodiac, but they’re often reduced to being nothing more than conflict-avoidant hopeless romantics. Let’s not forget this zodiac sign is also ruled by the scales, which means Libra’s main concern will always be righting wrongs and obtaining justice. In Harper Lee’s To Kill a Mockingbird, Atticus Finch is a prominent lawyer who fights on behalf of Tom Robinson, a Black man falsely accused of committing sexual assault. The heart and soul of this novel captures what it means to be a Libra; a zodiac sign that will always argue in favor of freedom and justice for all.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/71Djqom1jRL.jpeg><h2>Crime and Punishment by Fyodor Dostoyevsky</h2><p>Adjectives that describe Dostoyevsky’s Crime and Punishment include twisted, gripping, macabre and definitely dramatic. But most importantly of all, the story is all about recognizing the karma of your actions and owning up to the consequences. In this classic 19th century Russian novel, Raskolnikov murders his landlord and spends the remainder of the novel anxiously evading the detective who has been tasked with solving the crime. The psychological torment that he is put through—both by his society and by his own actions—captures the dark side of the Scorpio experience. After all, this is the zodiac sign of creation and destruction.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/710HcoP38L.jpeg><h2>The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien</h2><p>At the end of the day, every Sagittarius just wants life to be an adventure. And when it comes to literary classics, no novel is more adventurous than J R.R. Tolkien’s The Hobbit. Protagonist Bilbo Baggins lives a simple, monotonous life planted firmly within his comfort zone, but when the wizard Gandalf shows up at his cottage one day, he suddenly finds himself journeying Middle Earth with a pack of dwarves in an attempt to liberate the kingdom of Erebor. If there’s one thing a Sagittarius can take away from this thrilling and uplifting tale, it’s that there’s a whole world out there, just waiting to be explored!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/71PFN9kl1L.jpeg><h2>Jane Eyre by Charlotte Brontë</h2><p>Capricorns are famous for being hardworking, disciplined and determined to get the job done. But how do you think they got that way? Capricorn energy is so motivated and entrepreneurial because it’s a zodiac sign that is often accompanied with abandonment and hardship. Jane Eyre is an orphan who has been let down by all her caretakers, but her strength of spirit allows her to remain resilient and to take care of herself better than many in her situation would. The themes surrounding this novel are peak Capricorn, as the story of a woman overcoming the worst odds will inspire anyone to grit their teeth and rise to the occasion.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/BraveNewWorld_FirstEdition.jpeg><h2>Brave New World by Aldous Huxley</h2><p>Brave New World is a novel about a futuristic dystopian society in which everyone’s individual personalities are snuffed out and broken down. From a young age, this society conditions people to have no value in their relationships. People’s emotions are also dulled by their constant intake of an anti-anxiety drug called Soma. In this cautionary tale, Aldous Huxley examines what life would look like if we avoided all the hard parts of being human. If we aim to make everyone look, feel and experience the same things, we lose ourselves. Aquarius is not only the zodiac sign of individuality, but it also pushes for social progress. And through Brave New World, we are reminded of how easily we could lose what makes us human.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/71nXPGovoTL.jpeg><h2>The Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger</h2><p>Behind Holden Caulfield’s confusing stream of consciousness and his need to complain about a world that has become “phony,” the 16-year-old protagonist of The Catcher in the Rye is just a lost and lonely boy who’s grieving the death of his brother. Pisces is the last sign in the zodiac wheel and lives in the spirit world more than the material world. Steeped within their own thoughts and imaginations, Pisces are people who often feel like outsiders, and as Holden Caulfield struggles to make sense of the trauma and loss he has experienced, this all-American novel captures what it means to feel remote from the world. And if there’s one zodiac sign that’s good at disassociation and escapism, it’s Pisces.</p><p><a href=#><img decoding=async src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/zodiactravel_redirect-1.gif?w=670" alt="Zodiac Signs Travel | Culture Issue 2022" width=670 height=377 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6Kdnqukrrmme9mom6KZk2R%2BdICUam1rZ6qksaqtwmaqop%2BeqHqiv4yloK2dopbBtr7EaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./shows-like-big-little-lies.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Addictive Shows like Big Little Lies to Watch Now</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./best-raspberry-pi-cyberdecks.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The 5 Best Raspberry Pi Cyberdecks</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./20-year-sentence-2003-murder-ephrata-html.html>20-year sentence for 2003 murder in Ephrata</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./3-ways-can-remove-unwanted-blog-pages-google.html>3 Ways You Can Remove Unwanted Blog Pages From Google</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./5-rewarding-benefits-of-playing-the-violin.html>5 Rewarding Benefits of Playing the Violin</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./article-fbcffa51-ae5b-5b24-ba42-7821fc682093-html.html>Child molesters are the sweetest people | Columnists</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./woman-quells-racist-row-getting-boobs-train-html.html>Woman quells racist row by getting her boobs out on train</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaX.
