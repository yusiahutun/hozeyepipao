There's a lot of advice available on the internet about how best to answer interview questions.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Behavioral questions are a part of any job interview, and how you respond to them can determine if the interviewer moves you on to the next stage. There are various ways to approach behavioral questions, and you can choose which method works best for you based on your previous work experience.</p><h2 id=p-a-r>1. P.A.R.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/screenshot-of-par-explanation-from-resumeway-com.jpg><p>The P.A.R. method is a way to approach interview questions concisely. The P.A.R. method is an excellent way to boost interest in your resume, since you can insert a small table to showcase a particular challenge you overcame.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The <strong>P</strong> is for a problem or project. This means the first step is identifying a problem or project that will illustrate the skills the interviewer is asking about. The <strong>A</strong> stands for action. This part of your response is where you speak to the action you took to resolve the problem or your role in the project. The <strong>R</strong> represents the results that came from your action.</p><p>The P.A.R. technique is similar to the S.T.A.R. method in providing tools to practice interview questions using an acronym. The tools allow you to organize your thoughts in preparation for the stress of an interview. The P.A.R. method is a shorter and simpler acronym to remember. You can provide great detail as you share a problem or project you worked on.</p><p>Getting contacted for a job interview can feel like finding a needle in a haystack.

The method is a prescription for giving answers that are comprehensive and concise.</p><p>The acronym S.O.A.R. stands for <strong>S</strong>ituation, <strong>O</strong>bstacle or <strong>O</strong>bjective, <strong>A</strong>ction, and <strong>R</strong>esults. The technique is similar to the S.T.A.R. method, with different action words for prompts.</p><p>When you answer an interview question with this technique, you describe the situation that sets the scene for the skill or expertise you want to highlight. You then define the obstacle you encountered or the project's objective.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Once you've set the stage, you explain the action you took to overcome the obstacle or your contribution to the project. You conclude your answer by discussing the results achieved quantitatively, if possible.

C.A.R. responses have a <strong>C</strong>hallenge, <strong>A</strong>ction, and <strong>R</strong>esult. You can use the C.A.R. method to answer any behavioral interview question. Preparation is the key to making a good impression on the interviewer with your response.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Using this method to develop a story with a memorable beginning, middle, and end is an excellent way to allow the interviewer to remember you and your qualifications. You start by describing a challenge you encountered, explaining why it was a challenge, and your role at the company.</p><p>In the middle of your story, you explain your actions to improve or resolve the situation. Mention the skills and expertise that helped you take the action you did. Finish your story by sharing the results of your actions and how they contributed to the company's or the project's success. In your conclusion, try using keywords in the job description to illustrate your understanding of the role's needs.</p><p>Preparation is vital to delivering an excellent response to a behavioral interview question.

Lin created the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">D.I.G.S. method</a> to respond to behavioral interview questions. If you view his website, he claims it's better than the S.T.A.R. method because most people formulate their responses mechanically, which lacks appeal.</p><p>The D.I.G.S. technique acronym stands for <strong>D</strong>ramatize the situation, <strong>I</strong>ndicate the alternatives, <strong>G</strong>o through what you did, and <strong>S</strong>ummarize your impact. This method was created to help you develop an entertaining and engaging story that feels like a casual conversation among friends.</p><p>This method emphasizes something that C.A.R. hints at: the importance of creating a memorable response. You don't know how many candidates are applying for the job, and you want to stand out.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When dramatizing the situation, provide details and context to describe your example and help the interviewer understand why it mattered. Indicating the alternatives allows you to illustrate how you approach situations and your thought process.</p><p>As you go through what you did, this is where you give the interviewer a concise replay of what you did, mentioning the skills and experience you used and gained in the process. When summarizing your impact, you want to say quantitative facts to show how your actions benefited the company or department.</p><h2 id=s-t-a-r-i>5. S.T.A.R.I.</h2><p>The S.T.A.R.I. method is a tweak to the S.T.A.R. method. In addition to crafting your response to cover the <strong>S</strong>ituation, <strong>T</strong>ask, <strong>A</strong>ction, and <strong>R</strong>esult, you should include the <strong>I</strong>mpact of your work.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Discussing the impact of the work on yourself, your colleagues, and the company can make your response more memorable.

S.T.A.R.L.</h2><p>Like the S.T.A.R.I. method, the S.T.A.R.L. technique is an adjustment to the S.T.A.R. method, adding <strong>L</strong>earning to your response that describes the <strong>S</strong>ituation, <strong>T</strong>ask, <strong>A</strong>ction, and <strong>R</strong>esult. Adding the learnings you gained from experience can give the interviewer a better idea of who you are and what matters to you.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=get-ready-for-your-next-interview>Get Ready for Your Next Interview</h2><p>Whether your calendar is booked with interviews or you're in the early stages of your job search, preparation is critical before you head into your next interview.
