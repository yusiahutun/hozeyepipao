One couple that won’t be winning, though, is Lakeyn Call and Bennett Sipes, as their fellow cast members recently voted them off the show.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Love-Island-1.jpg><p id=par-2_38>Before Call coupled up with Sipes, she was actually interested in Carrington Rodriguez. However, after seeing Rodriguez chose someone else, and after getting voted off the show, Call has since revealed some concerns she has about Rodriguez’s intentions.</p><h2>‘Love Island’ Season 2 has reached its finale</h2><p id=par-3_24>Love Island U.S.A. Season 1 premiered in the summer of 2019, and it is ultimately very similar to the U.K. version of Love Island.</p><p id=par-4_77>The show puts a bunch of singles on an island, where they spend time getting to know each another. The islanders then ultimately couple up with the person they feel they are most compatible with. However, the show introduces new singles throughout the entire season, so the islanders get many opportunities to recouple. The recoupling ceremonies then ultimately leave some of the islanders by themselves, which can potentially get them dumped from the villa and sent home.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-5_48>Additionally, fans get to vote for different things throughout the entire season, and they even get to vote on their favorite couple at the end of the season. The couple with the most votes at the end is then named the winning couple and gets a cash prize.</p><p id=par-6_47>In Season 2, many islanders have starred on the show, and many have left. Now, heading into the finale, four couples are left. The couples are: Cely Vazquez and Johnny Middlebrooks, Justine Ndiba and Caleb Corprew, Laurel Goldman and Carrington Rodriguez, and Moira Tumas and Calvin Cobb.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-7_26>Rodriguez and Goldman have pretty much been together since the midway point of the season, but Rodriguez was interested in a new islander at one point.</p><h2>Carrington Rodriguez was interested in Lakeyn Call on ‘Love Island’</h2><p id=par-8_21>Call was one of the last islanders to move into the Love Island villa, and she turned Rodriguez’s head pretty quickly.</p><p id=par-9_40>The two went on a date, and Rodriguez appeared to seriously consider leaving Goldman for her as they had several similarities. However, during the recoupling ceremony, Rodriguez chose to stay with Goldman, which seemed to rub Call the wrong way.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-10_33>She did not get dumped from the villa at that point, though. Bennett Sipes — who was also a newer islander — left the girl he was coupled up with for her.</p><p id=par-11_43>Sipes and Call then seemed to have a good connection for the short time they were together, but, recently, all the islanders had to choose the couple that they thought was least compatible. Sipes and Call’s fellow cast members ultimately sent them home.</p><h2>Lakeyn Call questions Carrington Rodriguez’s intentions</h2><p id=par-12_62>Despite the fact that Rodriguez picked Goldman over Call, Call said that she has no hard feelings toward him, and that she loves Rodriguez and Goldman each individually. However, she also said that she doesn’t think she and Sipes should have been the couple to leave the villa. She also doesn’t appear to think Rodriguez is with Goldman for the right reasons.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-4><p></p></figure><p id=par-13_78>“I feel that we shouldn’t have left, not being biased towards us, but just realistically if I was a different couple, looking in on it: Carrington and Laurel — I think Laurel is in love with Carrington and Carrington is just honestly with Laurel for the show,” Call said to <a href=#>ET Online</a>. “Once they get off the show, I really see him just being a hurtful person to her and just hurting her and leaving her pretty fast.”</p><p id=par-14_24>That’s interesting. It will be interesting to see what happens with Rodriguez and Goldman, and all of the couples, after the show ends.</p><p id=par-15_13>The Love Island Season 2 finale airs at 9 p.m. EST on CBS.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS5sMLEZqCspJGjsW64wKScsqZdmK6tuIyqrJ6rpJ68r7%2BMnJirqpmjtLW7zWapqJyinrS2sdmsZK2qpZp6qrrTnqWtoZ%2BjwG6txa2cq2WSmravs4yvpq2dlGK8p7KNoaumpF8%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./63769216268e3e90158b45c4-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Las Palmas: Kirian supera su ltima sesin de quimioterapia</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./drug-dealer-gets-11-years-killing-la-studio-exec-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Drug dealer gets 11 years in killing of LA studio exec</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./20-year-sentence-2003-murder-ephrata-html.html>20-year sentence for 2003 murder in Ephrata</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./3-ways-can-remove-unwanted-blog-pages-google.html>3 Ways You Can Remove Unwanted Blog Pages From Google</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./5-rewarding-benefits-of-playing-the-violin.html>5 Rewarding Benefits of Playing the Violin</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./article-fbcffa51-ae5b-5b24-ba42-7821fc682093-html.html>Child molesters are the sweetest people | Columnists</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./woman-quells-racist-row-getting-boobs-train-html.html>Woman quells racist row by getting her boobs out on train</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaX.
