I was working as an assistant fashion editor, writing about celebrity style — who wore what, why it worked, how to get the look, you know the drill — when I realized my own wardrobe was somewhat lacking. Nothing that I owned felt particularly special, and my closet was full of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>fast fashion finds</a> that said more about fleeting trends than it did about my <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>personal style</a>. So, with a few extra dollars in my bank account, I scrolled on over to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow">The Real Real</a>, found a style I'd been eyeing for a while, and checked out before I could change my mind.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I landed on this specific structured Prada bag because, to me, it felt more timeless and elegant than some of the other popular designer picks. The rectangle shape was a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>classic</a>, and there were zero bulky zippers, embellishments, or extra-large hardwear, which, in my mind, seemed distracting and too chaotic to really be considered versatile. Plus, the size was just big enough to hold the essentials (even a small laptop!) without overpowering my petite frame.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Once I added in the fact that I was buying it secondhand, and the site knocked over $1,000 off the original price tag, it felt like a super smart choice. I was being practical, buying a quality staple that would serve me for years to come rather than an impulse purchase I might not love in a few months.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And, I can't lie: The idea of walking around with the Prada logo on my arm — an instantly recognizable fashion house that's rich with history — seemed pretty cool, too. In a way, I now had something in common with the style icons I idolized and wrote about every day.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I'm happy to report that, five years after taking my Saffiano Lux out of its dust bag and slipping it onto my shoulder, it still feels like money well spent. I've gone on to wear that thing everywhere, from New York Fashion Week, with elaborate, eye-catching outfits, to brunch with friends, where it helps amp up a simple jeans and T-shirt combo. I've stuffed it with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>cardigans</a> and water bottles before heading to the office, and (carefully) slipped my makeup bag and a change of shoes in there for weddings. Partially due to the neutral color and somewhat simple design, I've found it looks just as great with a fancy gown as it does with a matching sweatsuit (and pairing Prada with your sweats truly is the celebrity way to wear it). It's become the bag I reach for whenever I'm in a pinch and have no clue what to wear. It mysteriously works every time.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Over the years, my bag has seen me through so many important moments and milestones — interviews, vacations, date nights, you name it — that, in a way, it's gained something that money can't buy: sentimental value. I admittedly haven't splurged on a bag like that since, but I know that when I do, it'll be another well thought out choice that will more than earn its spot in my rotation.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57xZqqoaGfo3yir8Keqqynop6ytHvBmp6sZ6CnrqWtjKyYn56Zlruwecuur2asn6mybr7Er6Cer12svLPAx2agrQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./matt-borne-and-kathryn-whitney.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Matt Borne and Kathryn Whitney</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./tory-lanez-and-joseline-hernandez.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Tory Lanez and Joseline Hernandez</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./20-year-sentence-2003-murder-ephrata-html.html>20-year sentence for 2003 murder in Ephrata</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./3-ways-can-remove-unwanted-blog-pages-google.html>3 Ways You Can Remove Unwanted Blog Pages From Google</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./5-rewarding-benefits-of-playing-the-violin.html>5 Rewarding Benefits of Playing the Violin</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./article-fbcffa51-ae5b-5b24-ba42-7821fc682093-html.html>Child molesters are the sweetest people | Columnists</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./woman-quells-racist-row-getting-boobs-train-html.html>Woman quells racist row by getting her boobs out on train</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaX.
