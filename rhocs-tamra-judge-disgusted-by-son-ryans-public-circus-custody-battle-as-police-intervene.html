"I'm absolutely disgusted and my only concern is Ava. Not my circus. Not my monkeys."</p><p>When a fan commented that Ryan was just as "crazy" and "guilty" as Sarah and suggested Tamra "stay out of it all together," the reality star hit back.</p><p>"You don't know that," she wrote. "No one knows the truth but us. They are both idiots for making this public."</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p>In Ryan's videos, which were captured by @realhousewivesfranchise Instagram account, he went off on his ex, claiming that Sarah wasn't permitting him to see their daughter because she was "mad" he posted stuff about her. Ryan also said his ex was using Ava as "leverage" and called it an act of "child abuse."</p><p>"She knows what our schedule's been," he said of Sarah. "Everyone around me knows what our schedule's been. I have my daughter every single Wednesday, until Thursday. Pick her up again on Fridays and I drop her off on Sundays."</p><p>"It's been that way for years now, years," he continued. "She wants to play the game because she's mad that I posted stuff about her. She's using my daughter as leverage. I would call that child abuse.</p><p>"All I wanted to do was pick up my daughter in my day off like I always do," Ryan concluded. "It didn't have to be this way. It's insane. It's crazy. The only one that suffers is my daughter and technically myself. It's bullshit. And I feel like this game is going to have to get worse before it gets better."</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p>Ryan then filmed a livestream of himself trying to pick up Ava from what appeared to be Sarah's house. According to the clips, when he arrived, Sarah had already called the police.</p><p>In the videos, Ryan is first seen talking to an officer as Sarah then walks over to her ex with a police escort.</p><p>"I'm going to record this whole thing," Ryan said in the clip. "I'm here to pick up my daughter, so this is what happens when I come to pick up my daughter."</p><p>Sarah, who said she saw Ryan's post, informed her ex that Ava wanted to stay with her mom. After Ryan claimed he was "calm" and just wanted to see his daughter, Sarah then brought up the alleged text conversation she had with Ryan last week where he told her to "go kill herself" before sending a photo of a bullet and writing, "This one is for you." (Tamra spoke all about this on <a href=#><strong>"WWHL"</strong></a> with <a href=#><strong>Andy Cohen</strong></a> last week.

It seemed that Sarah informed the cops of the messages as one of the police officers questioned Ryan about his well-being and asked if he thought about harming himself. Ryan denied any of the claims and expressed that he was "perfectly fine." Sarah disagreed and the police ended up separating the two.</p><p>While speaking to the police, Ryan apologized for his behavior. "I apologize if I'm coming off like an asshole," he said. "But I've had to deal with a lot of stuff and this is just like the last straw."</p><p>"I deal with this all the time," he added.</p><p>Ultimately, it looked like Ava didn't go home with Ryan, who claimed his daughter didn't want to go with him because she wanted to watch cartoons. However, it is likely there was more to the story. Watch the clips, below.</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p>Although Tamra deleted her post where she called her son's custody battle a "circus," the Bravo star shared <a href=#><strong>a quote</strong></a> to her Instagram profile not long after.</p><p>"To anybody who's reading this, I pray that you or whatever you are constantly stressing about gets better," the quote read. "May the dark thoughts, the overthinking, and the doubt exit your mind right now. May clarity replace confusion. May peace and calmness fill your life."</p><p>When a person called Ryan "very entitled" and "just plain mean" in the comments, Tamra fired back, "Thank you. The truth will come out soon. Don't believe everything people post. They usually have a motive."</p><p>"The Real Housewives of Orange County" airs Tuesdays at 9 p.m. on Bravo.</p><p><strong>Got a story or a tip for us?
