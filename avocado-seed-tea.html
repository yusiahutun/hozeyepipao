Though most people throw them away, the pits can be used to make a heart-smart drink known as avocado seed tea — for pennies!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How avocado seed tea improves heart health</h2><p>People in Africa, Central, and South America have used avocado seed tea for decades to promote health and well-being, thanks to its rich stores of beneficial compounds called <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">phytochemicals.</a> And while avocado seeds are incredibly nutrient-dense, they also have high concentration of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">soluble fiber</a> that safeguards your ticker.</p><p>“We know that avocado seeds contain healthy fatty acids, carbs, and a small amount of protein,” explains <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sonali Ruder, DO</a>, an emergency room doctor, trained chef and the founder of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Foodie Physician</a>. “They’re especially high in soluble fiber, which has several potential health benefits, including aiding in digestion and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">lowering cholesterol</a>. Fiber helps keep everything running smoothly in our intestinal tract, stabilizes blood sugar, and prevents heart disease.”</p><p><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=#>How To Ripen An Avocado In The Microwave: A Dietician Reveals The Best Method</a></p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Carmelita Lombera, RDN</a>, a registered dietitian based in Sacramento, California, agrees. “Avocado seed tea may improve heart health by lowering blood pressure and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">LDL or “bad” cholesterol</a>. The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">polyphenols</a> in the seed help limit <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">HMG-CoA reductase</a>, an enzyme responsible for the production of cholesterol. Many statin drugs act on this same enzyme, but they can also have side effects.” Those <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">statin side effects</a> can include muscle pain, liver damage and a spike in your blood sugar levels. (Click through to our sister publication to see how a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">citrus fruit called bergamot lowers high cholesterol</a>.)</p><p><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=#>Avocado Pit Removal: Use This Brilliant Hack to Avoid Cutting Yourself</a></p><p>Avocados also brim with potassium, “and the seed is an excellent source, too,” Lombera adds. Research in the journal Hypertension suggests that upping your intake of dietary potassium (also known as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">potassium citrate</a>) lowers systolic (top number) blood pressure by 13 points and diastolic (bottom number) blood pressure by 5 points. It works by relaxing blood vessels an helping flush excess salt from the body.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/GettyImages-961101662-2.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>More health benefits of avocado seed tea</h2><p>Avocado seeds can do more than just keep your heart strong. It turns out the grocery toss-out has total-body health benefits, too.</p><p>“These seeds contain several vitamins and minerals,” Dr. Ruder says. “They also have <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">bioactives</a>, which are plant-based compounds that have many potential health benefits such as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">reducing inflammation</a> and fighting chronic diseases like cancer. They even have anti-bacterial and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">antifungal properties</a>.” Here’s how sipping avocado seed tea can transform your health:</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>It improves your immunity</h3><p>Avocado seeds are loaded with antioxidants. In fact, as much as 70% of an avocado’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">antioxidants</a> are found in the seed, according to research in the journal Food Chemistry.</p><p>“Antioxidants are like protective superheroes for our cells, helping to prevent damage from <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">free radicals</a> that contribute to aging and chronic disease,” Dr. Ruder explains. “These antioxidants include vitamin C and vitamin E, which are especially important for boosting our <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">immu</a><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">nity</a>.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Avocado seed tea reduces chronic inflammation</h3><p>Avocado seeds protect health at the cellular level, warding off the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">chronic inflammation</a> that can dampen your energy and mood and accelerate aging. Avocado seeds are so beneficial, a study in the journal Advances in Food Technology and Traditional Sciences suggests their <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">anti-inflammatory</a> compounds may one day be used in pharmaceutical development.</p><p>“I would recommend avocado seed tea to anyone who is experiencing chronic inflammation from conditions such as obesity, heart disease, liver disease, diabetes, cancer, digestive issues, or hormonal imbalances,” Lombera says. “One compound inside avocado seeds, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">chlorogenic acid</a>, captures free radicals” that play a role in triggering inflammation. And researchers know that inflammation causes weight gain, and excess weight causes more inflammation. (Click through to learn more about <a href=#>how inflammation contributes to post-menopausal weight gain</a> and what to do about it.)</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>It steadies your blood sugar</h3><p>Compounds within avocado seed tea called <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">flavanoids</a> have been shown to help regulate energy-sapping blood sugar swings and dips. In fact, a study found these flavanoids reduce sugar absorption and increase insulin secretion in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">diabetes patients</a>.</p><p>And avocado seeds’ chlorogenic acid plays a role in steadying blood sugar, too. “It’s been shown to increase the GLP-1 hormone, which increases blood <a href=#>insulin</a> levels and slows down gastric emptying, making you feel fuller,” Lombera says. GLP-1’s effects on regulating blood sugar and aiding weight loss are well-known. A class of drugs called <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">GLP-1 antagonists</a> mimic the hormone’s actions by increasing insulin production after someone eats. (Click through to our sister site to discover how <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">natural GLP-1 alternatives</a> speed weight loss.)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/GettyImages-1245493687-2.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Homemade vs. store-bought avocado seed tea</h2><p>Ready to tap into the healing power of avocado seed tea? Both freshly-brewed avocado seed tea and store-bought varieties deliver the same health benefits. The difference: homemade brews cost just pennies per cup, but take a little more time to make. That’s because you have to let avocado seeds dry for at least three days before using them in tea. Lombera says fresh avocado seeds are rich in phytochemicals that can potentially be harmful in high doses. “If you don’t have time to dry and boil the seeds, buying them is an easier option.”</p><p>You can buy pre-made avocado seed teabags or powdered tea. “I personally recommend NutriCargo’s Avocado Pit Powder,” says Lombera. “I suggest this brand because all of their products undergo weekly testing for microbial pathogens and heavy metals. Since many companies sell tea made from avocado leaves, make sure the tea or powder you buy is derived from the seed/pit.” Try: NutriCargo Avocado Pit Power (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Buy from NutriCargo.com, $9.99</a>).</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How much avocado seed tea you should drink daily</h2><p>Avocado seed tea has powerful nutritional properties, but “there are concerns that some of the plant compounds in avocado seed could potentially be harmful,” explains Dr. Ruder. “Safety tests are in the early stages. So, if you’re going to try avocado seed tea, I wouldn’t overdo it and recommend sticking to one cup per day.”</p><p>Lombera concurs, noting that “drinking one cup has been shown to provide benefits. Since avocado seeds are so high in nutrients, you don’t need to drink any more than that.”</p><p>While avocado seed tea is widely enjoyed by most folks, there are few who should steer clear of the brew. Of course, anyone with an avocado intolerance or allergy should avoid avocado seed tea, says Dr. Ruder. “Also, avocado contains small to moderate amounts of vitamin K, which may interact with blood-thinning medications like Warfarin. So, if you’re on a blood thinner, consult with your doctor first,” Dr. Ruder adds.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How to make avocado seed tea at home</h2><p>Making avocado seed tea is easy and takes less than 15 minutes once you have your ingredients ready. “The avocado seed can impart a subtle bitterness to the tea,” says Dr. Ruder. “You’ll probably want to add a little sweetener like honey, or warm spices like cinnamon or ginger, to balance the flavor profile.” And as a fun bonus, “when you make your own avocado seed tea, the water turns a pinkish hue due to the polyphenols being released from the seeds,” Lombera adds.</p><p>What you’ll need:</p><ul><li>One or two avocado seeds (pits) that have dried for at least 3 days</li><li>3-4 cups of water</li><li>Honey and spice to taste</li></ul><p>To do:</p><ul><li>Rinse the avocado seeds in cool tap water to remove any debris.</li><li>Add the seeds and water to a tea kettle or small saucepan, then bring to a boil for 5 to 10 minutes or until soft.</li><li>Remove the skin, then grate or slice the soft, boiled avocado seeds into smaller pieces. Return to the kettle or saucepan and boil for another 10 minutes.</li><li>Remove from heat, then strain brewed tea into a mug. Sweeten with honey or spices to taste.</li></ul><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p><strong>Read on to discover more ways avocados improve your health:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Avocado Doesn’t Just Taste Great — It Can Also Help You Get in Shape</a></li><li><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Don’t Throw Away Your Avocado Peels!
