City Council is expected to decide by August whether to fund the event next year. This year's version last month lost 184 thousand dollars.

Council voted Wednesday to cover the loss and provide 16 thousand dollars for preliminary planning for next year's event.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebrityaccess.com/news/grafix/newsbulletic.gif border=0 align=center style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><b>Nashville Star Tour Kicks Off On June 18</b></p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebrityaccess.com/news/grafix/nashvillestarlogo.jpg align=left style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto>(CelebrityAccess MediaWire) — The Nashville Star Tour hits the road this summer, kicking off on June 18 in Kettering, OH, featuring the four finalists from USA Network's Nashville Star TV talent search. Brad Cotter, this year's winner, heads the package of young country talent with runners-up George Canyon, Matt Lindahl and Lance Miller.</p><p>"The Nashville Star Tour is really sizzling," notes Rob Beckham, the William Morris agent booking the tour. "We've had a terrific response so far." Currently there are 28 dates confirmed and producers of the our plan to carry it to as many cities as can be accommodated within the window of time established for the tour, which will stretch across the United States and into Canada.</p><p>"The Nashville Star Tour will recreate the energy and feel of the TV series," notes Brinson Strickland of 262 Five, Ltd., the company producing the tour. "The video screens at each concert venue will run highlights of each performer's segments from the series of shows. We're pleased to announce that the Nashville Star Band, the same group from the show, will be traveling with the tour and backing up each performer."</p><p>Each concert will run approximately 90 minutes. Performers will appear in reverse order of their finishes on the show. As the winner, Brad Cotter will close each show, preceded by George Canyon, Matt Lindahl and Lance Miller.</p><p>The Nashville Star Tour is also providing a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for local talent. "Promoters in the tour cities can run their own Nashville Star Tour contest," says Strickland. "Local winners will automatically go to the Regional Finals in the 2005 Nashville Star competition. They will also have a chance to open the Nashville Star Tour concert in their town."</p><p>Fans will have the chance to get up close and personal with the Nashville Star Tour performers. All four artists will be available for media interviews and meet-and-greet autograph sessions in each city. "We'll have Nashville Star merchandise along with items from each individual artist to sell," says Strickland. "We're hoping that each of the artists will bring CD singles or other original music that fans can purchase."</p><p>The Nashville Star winner receives a contract with Sony Nashville, along with other prizes. Last year's winner Buddy Jewell has already scored two Top 10 singles and a Gold album since his debut.

She died about 10:20 p.m., authorities said.</p><p>Police do not suspect foul play, but the city's licensing department would likely look into the accident to determine whether there were any violations and why a net was not in place. A city statute requires a net.</p><p>"Investigators are looking at that, but just because there is a law on the books does not mean that a criminal prosecution is going to ensue," said Paul Schnell, St. Paul police spokesman. "It appears that this is a terrible tragedy. We are not actively pursuing a criminal investigation and seeking charges against the circus."</p><p>Ringling Bros. also is investigating the cause, spokesman Mark Riddell said Sunday from the circus office in Vienna, Va. He said Ringling Bros. hadn't had a fatal accident in one of its circuses in at least the last 10 years.</p><p>James Honerman, a spokesman for the Minnesota office of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration, said his office will not conduct an investigation</p><p>"This type of risk is part of the act," he said. "This is part of the routine they do. It does not fit the typical OSHA fatality."</p><p>Shaken witnesses, who included many children, described the scene: Espana was upside-down, hanging on to long chiffon scarves by her legs and twirling around. Suddenly, a scarf loosened at the top and Espana plunged to the arena floor.</p><p>"The nature of aerial performance entails calculated risks," Riddell said, "and our safety record is a very good one over the course of 134 years."</p><p>A safety harness couldn't be used in Espana's act because of the way she had to move, and chiffon acts traditionally don't use nets, Riddell said.</p><p>Espana was taken to Regions Hospital about 12 minutes after she fell.</p><p>Witnesses had different accounts of how she landed — headfirst, on her stomach or on her back.</p><p>Immediately, there was silence. Clowns came out in what circusgoers described as an attempt to draw attention away from the scene. That worked for some of the younger children, but not for everyone.</p><p>"A little girl behind us asked, 'Is she still alive?' " said Kim Golembeck, of Big Lake, whose 3-year-old son didn't realize there had been an accident. "It was hard to hear."</p><p>Laurie Burnham and her 10- and 12-year-old daughters left after the accident because they were so upset about what they saw.</p><p>"They were really distraught, especially because the ringmaster started up again like nothing had happened," said Burnham, of St. Paul.</p><p>A performer on an adjacent piece of equipment was not injured, said Alexis Copeland, spokeswoman for the circus.</p><p>The 21/2-hour show continued as medical personnel and circus officials worked on Espana, who comes from a family of Bulgarian performers. She and Ivan Espana, from a Mexican family of performers, got married years ago during a show, according to circus promotional material. Their two children are in training to become circus performers.</p><p>Don Hughes was holding the spotlight on Espana when she fell. As soon as he comprehended what had happened, he moved the light away.</p><p>"It would have been undignified to keep it on her," said Hughes, who's spent 27 years lighting events and who said this was the worst accident he had seen.</p><p>Shows on Saturday night and Sunday went on as planned.</p><p>"The show must go on," Copeland said.</p><p>Last month, there were two accidents in three days when the Ringling Bros. circus performed in New York's Madison Square Garden. One man fell 30 feet from a trapeze into a net. Another slipped off a high wire. Both had minor injuries. Signs outside the venue had promoted the circus with the slogan, "Tempting fate daily."</p><p>In Minnesota, another acrobat was injured while performing an aerial maneuver before a crowd of 10,000 at the St. Paul Civic Center in April 1994. Shrine Circus performer Kristie Randall, then 19, of Pittsburgh, broke her hip and thighbone and underwent surgery after she fell 60 feet.</p><p>A rampaging circus elephant killed a trainer and injured another worker before at Circus International in Honolulu in 1994. In 1993, a Ringling Bros. elephant trainer was killed when an elephant stepped on him at the circus' elephant farm in Gainesville, Fla. In 1988, a Circus USA trapeze artist was killed in a fall during a performance in Hialeah, Fla.</p><p>Perhaps the highest-profile recent circus-related accident happened in Las Vegas last October when Roy Horn, of "Siegfried & Roy," was severely mauled on stage by a tiger, forcing an end to the duo's long-running show.</p><p>Circus performers take risks because they have "a desire to push the limit, to inspire people and show people what human beings are capable of," Riddell said. "The thing circus performers have in common is they're constantly striving to be the best in the world at what they do."</p><span itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Article class=itempropwp-wrap></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCam5OawLR6wqikaJuRlr%2BktMivnGisn6q%2FqrrGZp2eq6Sew6K4jKecsKtdoq6zr4yapa2gn6PGbrzOrKupp56awG7Azq6pZqyfYrOqusisn2asp6R6pLDSaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./clint-capela.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Clint Capela dating?
