Now, during the Lisbon leg of his tour, the singer took his candid concert style to the next level by helping an audience member propose to his girlfriend.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In the middle of the set, the fan grabbed Styles's attention by yelling out, "Can I sing two lines to my girlfriend?" The audience gave an immediate response of oo-ing and awe-ing at the gesture.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">After a bit of back and forth, in which Styles cheekily inquired about how long the two have been dating ("More than a year," was the answer), the Grammy winner handed over the mic, an action that was accompanied by validating screams from the rest of the stadium.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">To everyone's surprise, the fan began to sing classic love song, "Can't Help Falling in Love" by <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/film-tv/a40243460/catherine-martin-elvis-movie-costumes/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Elvis Presley" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Elvis Presley</a>. The pop sensation's face immediately lit up, and the rest of the audience joined in on the song—Styles included.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The singer happily watched the couple on the big screen above the stage. After singing a few lines from the love song, the man conjured more screams when he got down on one knee. Speaking into the mic, he asked, "Will you marry me?" His now fiancé grabbed the mic from him and screamed, "Yes!"</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Styles ran up and down the stage, encouraging screams from the audience, and happily watched as the fan put a ring on his girlfriend's finger.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Concertgoers seem to have an affinity for relying on Styles to assist them in momentous occasions in their life.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Last November, an audience member from his sold-out Wisconsin show <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a38173036/harry-styles-helps-fan-come-out-concert/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="enlisted Styles's help to come out to her mom" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">enlisted Styles's help to come out to her mom</a>. After reading a fan's sign that read, "My mom is in section 201. Help me come out," Styles agreed. "Lisa, she's gay!" he declared into the mic.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The fan later thanked Styles on Twitter, writing, "A moment that will actually be with me forever. thank you for creating a safe place for me. Thank you for letting me grow along side you as a fan. thank you for helping me know who I am. thank you."</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/bee310fd-0006-45a8-8d5a-72a4d63c27a9_1654876458.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Melody Leibner" title="Headshot of Melody Leibner" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Melody Leibner is the Digital Editorial Intern for&nbsp;<a href=#>BAZAAR.com</a>, where she covers e-commerce and shopping, fashion and celebrity news, and all things pop culture.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfmLKtscGroK2xX6GutbHSrWaabGBtfnqAmHFmoZmip8Zuv9Oyo56rXZ2yrbzSZp2apl2lv7C8zqycZpufo7CmvtNo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./joe-ambrosole.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Joe Ambrosole dating?
