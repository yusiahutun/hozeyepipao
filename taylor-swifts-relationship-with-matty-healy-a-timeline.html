And who uses a typewriter anyway?&nbsp;</p><p id=eqT4WZa7-F1 data-wc=73>Even if that particular song wasn’t about the 1975 frontman, we think it’s fair to suggest that more than one tune on the new album The Tortured Poet’s Department is about Taylor’s former flame. So if you need a reminder of how things went down with ‘Tatty’, we’ve got you covered. From the first hints of their romance to every song we think might be a Matty reference, here is their relationship timeline…&nbsp;</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>WATCH: Taylor Swift's relationships over the years</figure><h3>2014: Matty and Taylor meet&nbsp;</h3><p id=el4ByLqt4nT data-wc=58>Although nothing happened between the pair, Taylor went to see The 1975 with her friends Karlie Kloss and Lily Aldridge, where she met the singer. At the time, Matty told Australia’s 2DayFm: “We met each other, we exchanged numbers in the same way that a lot of people in this kind of world do, and we spoke occasionally.”&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/fbcdc334b4cf-gettyimages-464408478.jpg><h3>2016: Matty’s quotes are taken ‘out of context’&nbsp;</h3><p id=e4GrrnhhtsAb data-wc=50>Speaking to Q Magazine, Matty spoke about his alarm at being linked to Taylor Swift. He said: “If I had gone out with Taylor Swift I would've been, ‘[Expletive] hell! I am not being Taylor Swift's boyfriend.' You know, [Expletive]. That.' That's also a man thing, a de-masculinating, emasculating thing.”&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/722a4869bce4-matty-healy-2.jpg><p id=etSF9MBbAC5k data-wc=48>He later shared a post claiming that his quotes were taken out of context and that he “had fears of being 'somebody's boyfriend' (remember this is all speculation as we never dated!) before even being recognized for my music or presence as a person in my own right”.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/16d7393661e3-gettyimages-1490595307.jpg><p id=eg9CgC3OUJ80 data-wc=39>Praising Taylor, he continued: “I found her to be one of the most gracious, hard-working, creatively gifted, and beautiful women that I have had the pleasure to meet.

The star performed Anti-Hero and The City with the band during the surprise appearance, sparking rumours that the pair might be somewhat friendly.&nbsp;</p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on Twitter</a><h3>April 2023: Pap pictures say a thousand words&nbsp;</h3><p id=el8_6OOGLp0k data-wc=85>A month after it was confirmed that Taylor and her ex-boyfriend Joe Alwyn had parted ways, there are plenty of snaps of Taylor and Matty together - as well as Matty regularly attending Taylor’s Era tour - that there was no doubt that the pair were an item. They appeared to solidify it after they both mouthed: “This is about you. You know who you are. I love you,” during their performances, which was of course captured by camera-wielding concertgoers and shared on social media.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/f98cb1b11e6b-gettyimages-1179298988.jpg><h3>June 2023: Is it over now?

He said: “Do not come for me. Trust me. You know who I’m talking to. Honestly, you know who you are. I’m as mental as I seem. I have the receipts. Don’t [expletive] with me.
