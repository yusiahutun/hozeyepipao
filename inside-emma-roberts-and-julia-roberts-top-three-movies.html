First, however, let’s examine their top three individual movie performances.</strong></p><p>One family connection most movie fans might not have made is that of actress Julia Roberts and her niece Emma Roberts. Yes! In case you didn’t know, the two are related. If you didn’t make the connection through the name, you should’ve at least spotted the similarities in looks.</p><p>A significant reason why their relationship hasn’t been in the news like one might’ve expected is partly due to Julia’s once strained relationship with Emma’s father, Eric, who is also an actor.&nbsp;</p><p>Eric, who was previously married to Emma’s mother, Kelly Cunningham, struggled with drugs and alcohol early in his career. His struggles with those elements eventually led to his split from Kelly while Emma was still a toddler.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.pinimg.com/564x/98/4b/51/984b517ce5d461554418ec0e73380614.jpg><p>Surprisingly during the divorce proceedings, Julia supported Kelly over her brother Eric. The famous actress reportedly funded Kelly’s legal case because she believed her brother couldn’t care for Emma.</p><p>Eric’s relationship with his sister Julia and ex-wife Kelly throughout the divorce hearings deteriorated. Thankfully, the actor has since repaired his relationship with the two.&nbsp;However, the only relationship that has <a href=#>remained </a>unchanged is that of Julia and her niece Emma. The latter spent some parts of her childhood following Julia to her movie sets.&nbsp;</p><p>Those experiences inspired her and ignited her passion and love for acting. It also strengthened the bond between Emma and the <a href=#>recognized </a>“Pretty Woman” actress, who happens to be her aunt.&nbsp;</p><p>Emma has worked her way into becoming one of the best actresses in the present Hollywood roster. Although she is still far from reaching her aunt’s heights, Emma has done well in her career.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite their closeness, one surprising thing is Emma and Julia haven’t starred in a film together yet. Of course, we expect that collaboration to happen very soon but for now, let’s look at their top three individual performances.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=EMMA_ROBERTS></span><strong>EMMA ROBERTS</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Scream_Queens_2015></span><strong>Scream Queens (2015)</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>“Scream Queens” is a 2015 horror-comedy series about a serial killer stalking college girls in a sorority.
