"And I'm totally okay with it, it's all good. I don't mind any of this."</p><p>He then confirmed, "We spent the night together, that was it. That was the last time that I saw her physically."</p><p>The reality TV star also revealed that at the time, producers of "The Bachelor" strongly discouraged his attendance at the party, as his season was still airing.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:d4e34aa3-e792-470c-9c39-352f04a92921 data-container-ref=toofab:article:5ba85be0-69f2-4cf7-b1fd-cab58ded5b3b data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/ea/5by4/2021/11/03/ea880bd776d3409986c18af9f9c24801_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">ABC</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Bachelorette Blowup: Temper Tantrums and Michelle Finally Taking Out the Trash</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Brown first appeared on Colton Underwood's season of the show, before fronting "The Bachelorette," on which Weber was a contestant and placed third. In her upcoming novel <a href=#>"God Bless This Mess,"</a> she writes that while the two hooked up, their emotional connection had faded away.</p><p>"The chemistry just wasn't there, it just sucked," Brown wrote -- via <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>PEOPLE</a> -- about the experience. "And then, I found out he had another girl [runner-up Madison Prewett] on his mind. It was all so bizarre."</p><p>Weber too admitted that their connection wasn't quite the same.</p><p>"I agree with what she said. It wasn't the same as I think we had originally felt," he told listeners. "But, nonetheless, it was great to talk and just have someone that kind of understood where I was coming from."</p><p>It seems there are no hard feelings on either side, with Weber extending an invitation to Brown to appear on his podcast and Hannah telling PEOPLE she has "no ill will" toward anyone.</p><p>On his season, Peter wound up proposing to Hannah Ann Sluss, though they called it quits before the season finished airing. He eventually started dating fifth runner-up Kelley Flanagan and the two were together for 10 months.</p><p>Flanagan seemingly commented on the drama surrounding Hannah and Peter by posting a selfie her her holding up a peace sign to her Instagram Story with the caption, "Damn, looks like I needs to write a book. Book coming 2022, maybe 2023."</p><a id=gallery-link-4e39ed25-e648-4b5c-a1b3-2709288e70e0 class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:4e39ed25-e648-4b5c-a1b3-2709288e70e0 data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:5ba85be0-69f2-4cf7-b1fd-cab58ded5b3b data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/77/4by3/2021/11/17/77873d1c932b4d04a28b56975233cfd7_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3J7kGpmanBfpbK1sdFmrp6alad6pLvNn6CrpaNiwKav0Z6rZqCfpLi2vIywoK2gXZ2ur7rAoWSbqp%2Bsu27Dx6KjnmWYnsBuv8SaqqimXayutHnAoqmippdk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./rachel-rileys-crude-boob-comment-25426698.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Rachel Riley's 'crude' boob comment leaves antiques expert red-faced</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./lush-curly-hair-collection.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Lush's Curly Hair Collection Is Great for Coily and Textured Hair Types</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./20-year-sentence-2003-murder-ephrata-html.html>20-year sentence for 2003 murder in Ephrata</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./3-ways-can-remove-unwanted-blog-pages-google.html>3 Ways You Can Remove Unwanted Blog Pages From Google</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./5-rewarding-benefits-of-playing-the-violin.html>5 Rewarding Benefits of Playing the Violin</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./article-fbcffa51-ae5b-5b24-ba42-7821fc682093-html.html>Child molesters are the sweetest people | Columnists</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./woman-quells-racist-row-getting-boobs-train-html.html>Woman quells racist row by getting her boobs out on train</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaX.
