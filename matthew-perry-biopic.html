Matthew Perry died at the age of 54 from an apparent drowning, according to <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>TMZ</a>. The publication reported that the Friends actor was found dead in a hot tub at his home in Los Angeles, California, on Saturday, October 28, 2023.</p><p>Initial reports claimed that there were no drugs found at the scene and no foul play was involved, however, an investigation into how Matthew Perry died is still ongoing. Having completed the autopsy, investigators are still waiting on the complete toxicology results. On November 1, 2023, TMZ reported that law enforcement <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://www.tmz.com/2023/11/01/matthew-perry-fentanyl-meth-negative-tests/ rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ran a less-in-depth test</a> on Perry which revealed he did not have fentanyl or meth in his system. However, it will take months to conduct more in-depth tests to see if other illegal drugs were present in his blood or if he took prescription drugs at a higher dose.</p><p>The medical examiner updated its&nbsp;online record&nbsp;for Perry on the afternoon of October 29, listing <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>his cause of death as “deferred.”</a></p><p>“In cases where the cause of death cannot be determined at the time of autopsy, a deferred certificate will be issued until additional studies have been completed,” according to the LA coroner’s guidelines.</p><p>A spokesperson for the Los Angeles Fire Department told CNN in a Monday, October 30, statement: “A bystander had brought the man’s head above the water and gotten him to the edge, then Firefighters removed him from the water upon their arrival,” they said. “A rapid medical assessment, sadly, revealed the man was deceased prior to first responder arrival.”</p><p>After Perry’s death first made headlines, more information continued to emerge about his passing, with TMZ following up their story with details about the actor’s final hours. The outlet reported that Perry spent his morning playing pickleball and arrived home after a two-hour session on the court. When he got home, he reportedly sent his assistant out on an errand. When his assistant returned about two hours later, he found Perry unresponsive and called 911.</p><p>A rep for the Los Angeles Police Department confirmed the call without identifying Perry, telling <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://www.etonline.com/matthew-perry-friends-actor-dead-at-54-213834>Entertainment Tonight</a>, “West L.A. officers responded to [a residence] at 4:10 p.m. for a Death Investigation of a male in his 50s.”</p><p>Warner Bros. issued a statement about Perry following his death. “We are devastated by the passing of our dear friend Matthew Perry. Matthew was an incredibly gifted actor and an indelible part of the Warner Bros. Television Group family,” the statement read. “The impact of his comedic genius was felt around the world, and his legacy will live on in the hearts of so many. This is a heartbreaking day, and we send our love to his family, his loved ones, and all of his devoted fans.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/matthew-perry-book.jpeg><p>‘Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing’ by Matthew Perry</p><p>For more about Matthew Perry, read his memoir, <a data-pmc-sp-product=c44302c90f1fb94120d9107c47354ad1 href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing: A Memoir","price":"17.09","id":"1250866456","category":"Performing Arts"},"id":1660205,"location":true}' custom-ga-track=click rel=nofollow>Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing</a> . The New York Times bestseller takes readers through Perry’s life and career, from his childhood dreams of becoming an actor to how he was cast in Friends to his struggle with addiction and his stints in rehab. “Hi, my name is Matthew, although you may know me by another name. My friends call me Matty. And I should be dead,” Perry writes in the book. Told in his own words for the first time ever, the memoir is an “unflinchingly honest, moving, and uproariously funny” account of Perry’s trials and triumphs. Described as an “unforgettable memoir that is both intimate and eye-opening,” Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing is a must-read for Friends fans.</p><p>If you or someone you know is struggling with substance abuse, help is available.
