He also reportedly argued she was "too similar" to <a href=#><strong>Blake Shelton</strong></a>, who'd been with the show since the beginning.</p><p>When her lawyer asked her how she was able to recall such a specific conversation from so many years ago, Clarkson replied plainly, "Well, a wife doesn't forget a time she gets told she's not a sex symbol, so that stays."</p><p>Kelly Clarkson would eventually land a gig on The Voice, starting in 2018 with Season 14. She would develop a great sparring rapport with Shelton, becoming one of the show's most popular Coaches.

She took her eponymous talk show with her, but left The Voice behind.</p><p>She admitted to <a href=#><strong>USA Today</strong></a> in October that she was spreading herself too thin in Los Angeles, citing her work on The Voice. "I've learned a lot about what I'm capable of handling, and also what you should not handle," she told the outlet. "That was me saying 'bye' to 'The Voice' and having this big move."</p><p>"I love that family, but I was like, 'I'm struggling. I can't smile anymore," Clarkson continued. "I don't feel like smiling." Now, she says she's happier than ever with the new NY-based Kelly Clarkson Show.</p><a id=gallery-link-abd22221-fc30-4f51-9a90-496631adfc40 class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:abd22221-fc30-4f51-9a90-496631adfc40 data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:3fc0dee3-480c-4dbe-81f1-5f252d99617f data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/d8/4by3/2024/01/02/d8266f01622840f5ae5ee9387f90d142_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3V7j2pmaWtfoLKtuNhmmqWZoqDAsLqMnq9mmqKWu6W7zWaZpZmToMC1u8KkZKyglWLEor%2FNrWSsnaiueqa6zq6eoWWknbJuws6imp5n</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./peoples-flag-milwaukee.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The Peoples Flag of Milwaukee Chris Coyier</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./hundreds-show-up-for-turkey-trot.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Hundreds show up for Turkey Trot</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./20-year-sentence-2003-murder-ephrata-html.html>20-year sentence for 2003 murder in Ephrata</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./3-ways-can-remove-unwanted-blog-pages-google.html>3 Ways You Can Remove Unwanted Blog Pages From Google</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./5-rewarding-benefits-of-playing-the-violin.html>5 Rewarding Benefits of Playing the Violin</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./article-fbcffa51-ae5b-5b24-ba42-7821fc682093-html.html>Child molesters are the sweetest people | Columnists</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./woman-quells-racist-row-getting-boobs-train-html.html>Woman quells racist row by getting her boobs out on train</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaX.
