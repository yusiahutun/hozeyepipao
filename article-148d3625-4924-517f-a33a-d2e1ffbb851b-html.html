He said the group’s First Amendment rally will take on the federal government’s ever-increasing intrusion into Mississippi.</p><p>“All of us — black and white — need to wake up,” Waller said, “or we’ll all be picking cotton for the brown man.”</p><p>Laurel Mayor Johnny Magee said Friday that the organization had yet to file any paperwork. He said if the group does, they will be treated like any other organization asking for a parade permit. Waller, though, is seeking a Class D permit that would require little security and be exempt from fees. The city in October adopted&nbsp;a second reading of the parade ordinance. The Class D permit states:</p><p>“A special event which will require minimum or no City services. Class D permits will be issued for events such as Memorial Day services, Veterans Day programs, National Day of Prayer programs, victim and crime recognition Events, and similar programs.”</p><p>According to the group’s website, “We are The United Dixie White Knights, Born of a merger between Mississippi Klansmen Feb 2013. We are True Confederate White Knights that seek the return of the American Republic as it was founded and the Constitution as it was originally written, without amendments added by Tyrants. We seek an end to ALL illegal immigration, Race Mixing, The Loss of American Sovereignty, The Fed, IRS and all powers not granted the President in the Original Constitution.</p><p>Waller was elected as imperial wizard of&nbsp;the statewide Realm of Mississippi, the state- wide Klan organization. His local group consists of members in Jones, Greene, Perry and Wayne counties.</p><p>His group says gay marriage, which was voted down by 86 percent of the vote when it appeared on the Mississippi election ballot in 2004, should not be thrown in the faces of a state that overwhelmingly voted against it.</p><p>“It’s an unnatural marriage,” Waller said.</p><p>On immigration, he said Jones County is a hotbed for illegal immigration because of the large businesses here.</p><p>“Laurel has a huge immigration problem,” he said. “It’s those who hire them who are the real problem, though. … We are letting an entire third-world population turn our country into a&nbsp;third-world cesspool.”</p><p>He also said he knew&nbsp;Sam Bowers, a Jones County Klansman who served six years in federal prison for the murders&nbsp;of civil rights activists Andrew Goodman, James Chaney and Mickey Schwerner in 1964, and was sentenced to 32 years in the death of civil rights activist Vernon Dahmer of Hattiesburg. Bowers died at Parchman penitentiary in 2006.</p><p>“Laurel, at one time, was Klan country and it looks like it will be again,” Waller said.</p><p>While gays and immigrants are the targets, it is the overreaching federal government that Waller and his group are really rallying against.</p><p>“This country is just&nbsp;a shell of what it used to be,” Waller said. “They are violating our sovereignty and they are violating everyone’s rights.”</p><p>Waller said his group is willing to pay the $550 fee to have a parade, but wants to provide his own security.</p><p>“We seek a waiver of the insurance requirement as there are court cases on record that set a precedent that this would create a burden on our Organization to express our First Amendment rights under the U.S. Constitution. These cases were fought and won by the Klan,” he wrote in an email he sent to city officials before e-mailing it to the Leader-Call.</p><p>Waller said he will be willing to continue the fight in court if his group does not get the Class D waiver, saying it is a violation of the first amendment to put restrictions on such events. He expects that fewer than 500 people would attend the event.</p><p>“We don’t like the federal government coming in here and telling us what to do,” Waller said. “We didn’t like it in 1860 and we don’t like it now.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHAnZyrZZOWua16wqikaKaVrMBwuM6cmKVnm6C4br%2FEnqKsZZOewbp50ZqjpbFflr%2B1tcKlnJhpZG2xdIKRbmRtcWJpenZ9lp9kmmtjlnqlfsRqnZ%2Bakm2Ccq6NoaumpA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./450624-top-beautiful-polish-women-famous.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Top 15 most beautiful Polish women who are famous in 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./article-0866d922-95b1-11e8-9d3c-cb1744d8919b-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>John David Wynne Guice | Obituaries</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./20-year-sentence-2003-murder-ephrata-html.html>20-year sentence for 2003 murder in Ephrata</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./3-ways-can-remove-unwanted-blog-pages-google.html>3 Ways You Can Remove Unwanted Blog Pages From Google</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./5-rewarding-benefits-of-playing-the-violin.html>5 Rewarding Benefits of Playing the Violin</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./article-fbcffa51-ae5b-5b24-ba42-7821fc682093-html.html>Child molesters are the sweetest people | Columnists</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./woman-quells-racist-row-getting-boobs-train-html.html>Woman quells racist row by getting her boobs out on train</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaX.
