In addition, they look for ways to leverage robust solutions to create new revenue streams or enhance existing ones.</p><p>In this Interview with Matt Lepkowski, let us find out how they do it!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Tell us about Business Automation Expertspany.</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Business Automation Experts (BAE)</a> focuses on the strategic use of technology to improve operational efficiencies so our clients reach their goals. We specialize in finding ways to leverage robust solutions to create new revenue streams or enhance existing streams.</p><ul><li><strong>What were the initial challenges you faced?</strong></li></ul><p>Many of our clients are in the healthcare vertical and operational efficiency wasn’t as large a focus in the technology departments in the early 2000’s.&nbsp; Sharepoint deployments didn’t accelerate in healthcare until the 2010’s.&nbsp; Sometimes having the right vision but being too early impedes the potential for your firm.</p><ul><li><strong>Which was that point that triggered the growth of Business Automation Experts?</strong></li></ul><p>As Sharepoint and better experiences were delivered over web browsers we were able to see more rapid development.&nbsp; We are starting to see the next wave as cloud delivered options are replacing on-premise systems.</p><ul><li><strong>What is the reason behind your company’s long-standing success?</strong></li></ul><p>We are proud of the successes we have accomplished that are driven by a passion to meet client needs. Clients trust us to improve processes, increase security, and eliminate System Debt.</p><ul><li><strong>What are the products/services Business Automation Experts focuses on? How are your services different from those in the market?</strong></li></ul><p>We can show you how an Enterprise Content Management Plus System can bring your organization to the next level. This is a combination of Document Management Software (DMS) and Enterprise Content Management (ECM).We are working on combining various web delivered solutions to further improve operations for our clients.</p><ul><li><strong>How do you decide to take the company a step further in terms of your products/services?</strong></li></ul><p>Our clients find value in both DMS and ECM solutions separately and the combination of the two is very synergistic. There are various right sizing and system implementation steps we go through to make sure everything is done as efficiently as possible.</p><p>Clients trust us to improve processes, increase security, and eliminate System Debt.</p><ul><li><strong>Is there any new addition to the list of products/services? Anything exciting you would like to share?</strong></li></ul><p>We are combining security event and remediation systems (aiSEIM) with content management services to deliver a more automated compliance framework for clients.&nbsp; As clients try to optimize their security posture they still need to maintain the reporting for incidents and simplify the tracking of a resolution to a system breach.</p><ul><li><strong>What do you think are the responsibilities of an entrepreneur?</strong></li></ul><p>An entrepreneur is someone who remains motivated and passionate about delivering value to clients. To do that, they launch an organization with formularized policies and procedures to drive innovation and meet client needs. Ideally, they are subject matter experts and help a client more quickly realize their own objectives.</p><ul><li><strong>Can you please brief us about your professional experience?</strong></li></ul><p>An Information Technology expert with over 25 years of experience in project management and aligning information systems with corporate strategy. A detailed and highly capable IT professional specializing in analyzing data for cost savings and ROI as well as custom development plans.&nbsp; Founder of Business Automation Experts (BAE), a leading consulting firm with unmatched expertise to focus on the strategic use of technology to improve the operational efficiency of clients.</p><ul><li><strong>What are the key achievements of your entrepreneurial journey?</strong></li></ul><p>Aside from being the owner of Business Automation Experts (BAE), I played an instrumental role in supporting the growth of a previous firm from $2M to $25M in 6 years.</p><ul><li><strong>What does your work culture look like? How do you keep your employees motivated and driven?</strong></li></ul><p>Business Automation Experts (BAE) revolves around client satisfaction and continuous improvement. We review technology trends and compare those to the vision our clients bring.&nbsp; Our staff enjoys assisting clients take the next step to expand and better serve their constituents.&nbsp; There is a virtuous feedback loop that helps us find new clients and solve interesting challenges.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Can you tell us which your favourite book is? And your favourite part of the book (if any)?</strong></li></ul><p>I enjoy books written by Jim Collins like “Good to Great” where there are case studies of situations and how companies remain resilient during market swings.</p><ul><li><strong>Whose business story do you find the most inspiring?</strong></li></ul><p>I admire Ken Langone’s story and how he is translating his experiences to improving medical education and care.</p><ul><li><strong>What is your take on the competition in the market? How do you cope with it?</strong></li></ul><p>Competition is always dynamic in the <a href=#>IT environment</a>.&nbsp; I like to say that we live in dog years in IT with all of the changes coming at us.&nbsp; In healthcare there are a number of challenges which also keep us on our toes with changing regulation.&nbsp; Several years ago we didn’t spend much time thinking about professional <a href=#>hacking groups impacting</a> our operations and testing system resiliency.&nbsp; Today you have to consider more risks for a client and if you are helping them adapt to their own challenges you don’t need to be as concerned with who says they can handle your job at a lower price point.</p><ul><li><strong>Is competition a motivating factor? Does it help to bring out the best?</strong></li></ul><p>I would say competition helps with motivation, but it is more motivating to see a client succeed at their mission.&nbsp; When a physician office handles more patients because of system improvements or a veterinary clinic has more unique offerings for their clients there is a sense of accomplishment that encourages us to take on the next challenge.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqyr8DEq6eroaOaxLC%2By51lnKedZK%2B2v8innKyrXZbCtbvMmquip55isrm8xKurrA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./6580aa1046163fca2f8b4595-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Qu bancos cobran menos comisin por retiro en cajero 2023?
