The women met cordially before filming began but then Celeste, a chipper morning person, got off on the wrong foot with Bette. “Celeste said, ‘Oh good morning! Isn’t it a wonderful day?’ And Bette glowered at her and said, ‘Oh s–t, good manners,’” relates <strong>Sam Staggs</strong>, author of All About All About Eve. “Celeste claimed she never spoke to Bette again!” Both women would receive Oscar nominations for Eve, but the accolades did nothing to soften the rancor between them. “In the 1980s, the topic of Celeste came up and Bette referred to her as an expletive!” says Staggs.</p><p>In addition to the Hollywood veterans, All About Eve, which was based on Mary Orr’s short story The Wisdom of Eve, featured a performance from a then little-known blonde named Marilyn Monroe. George Sanders, who won a supporting actor Oscar for playing a sharp-tongued theater critic, claimed Bette took an instant dislike to Marilyn. “He said that Bette whispered after a shot, within poor Marilyn’s hearing, ‘That little blonde can’t act her way out of a paper bag,’” recounts Staggs, who doubts the story is true. “Marilyn was a starlet at the time, and nobody guessed she was going to become a megastar. I don’t think Bette would go out of her way to insult a young woman who was obviously very timid.”</p><p>Gary Merrill, who played Margot’s fiancé, also was able to see beyond Bette’s diva reputation. “They met during a make-up test, and as the filming went on they fell in love,” says Staggs. Bette was in the process of divorcing her third husband at the time, but Gary was still married. “In the divorce proceedings, his wife claimed that Gary went to San Francisco [where part of Eve was filmed] planning to have an affair with Anne Baxter!”</p><p>Despite those claims, the relationship between Bette and Gary was clearly genuine. “Their kisses, embraces and arguments on-screen feel very authentic and make their relationship in the film all the more credible,” says Staggs. The costars wed on July 28, 1950, in Mexico, just weeks after Eve wrapped, although the marriage lasted only 10 years.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/bette-davis-gary-merrill.jpg><p>Eve, however, garnered 14 Oscar nominations, a record unmatched until 1997’s Titanic and 2016’s La La Land. The film “resurrected me from the dead,” said Bette, whose career would continue to thrive for decades.</p><p>— Reporting by Katie Bruno</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46ao6VlkZe8tsCMnq2eZaOasLOx06xkm52kqbJusMCvoKxlkaOxbq%2FEpZysrJVitbC4zKxkn52lmXqxuNSsZKanopp8</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./uaw-local-79-strikers-returned-to-picket-lines-thursday.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>UAW Local 79 strikers returned to picket lines Thursday WHBF OurQuadCities.com</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./chlorogenic-acid-coffee-antioxidant.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Chlorogenic Acid in Coffee May Help Balance Blood Sugar</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./20-year-sentence-2003-murder-ephrata-html.html>20-year sentence for 2003 murder in Ephrata</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./3-ways-can-remove-unwanted-blog-pages-google.html>3 Ways You Can Remove Unwanted Blog Pages From Google</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./5-rewarding-benefits-of-playing-the-violin.html>5 Rewarding Benefits of Playing the Violin</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./article-fbcffa51-ae5b-5b24-ba42-7821fc682093-html.html>Child molesters are the sweetest people | Columnists</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./woman-quells-racist-row-getting-boobs-train-html.html>Woman quells racist row by getting her boobs out on train</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaX.
