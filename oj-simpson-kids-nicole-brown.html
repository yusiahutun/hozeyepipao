However, StyleCaster may receive a commission on orders placed through its retail links, and the retailer may receive certain auditable data for accounting purposes.</p><p>After his passing, it may come as a surprise to some to find out that <a href=#>OJ Simpson’s kids with Nicole Brown</a> were both by his bedside in the hours before his death. The former NFL star and his ex-wife welcomed a daughter, Sydney, and a son, Justin, years before he was accused of murdering her and later found liable for her death.</p><p><a href=# rel=nofollow>TMZ</a> was the first to report that Sydney, now 38, and Justin, 35, were among those who visited him at his home in the final days leading up to death on April 10, 2024. His two other living children from his previous <a href=# data-type=pmc_list data-id=1750552>marriage to Marguerite Whitley</a>, Jason and Arnelle, were also reportedly at their father’s bedside during his last moments (Simpson and Whitley were also parents to daughter Aaren, who tragically passed away at the age of two from an accidental drowning.)</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/kentucky-derby-2.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/buffing-bar.jpg><p>According to the outlet, visitors who came to see Simpson during his hospice care were required to sign NDAs for privacy—and that includes all medical personnel, friends, and even family—so it’s unlikely we’ll hear any direct details about Simpson’s final moments from his two children with Brown. However, sources did tell TMZ that a medical professional gave the heads up to family members on April 5, 2024, that Simpson, who had been diagnosed with prostate cancer and began receiving chemotherapy treatments earlier in the year, was beginning to decline, prompting his loved ones to gather at his bedside.</p><p>The inclusion of <a href=# id=auto-tag_oj-simpson data-tag=oj-simpson>OJ Simpson</a>‘s kids with Nicole Brown may be shocking to some, considering the former NFL running back was accused of murdering his ex-wife and her friend, Ronald Goldman, in 1994. What followed was one of the most famous and controversial criminal trials in American history, otherwise known as the People v. OJ Simpson. The trial, which began in 1995, lasted for nearly nine months, during which the prosecution presented evidence including DNA, blood samples, and a bloody glove found at the crime scene. However, Simpson’s defense team, led by famous attorneys Johnnie Cochran and Robert Kardashian, raised doubts about the integrity of the evidence and argued that Simpson was framed by racist police officers.</p><p>In the end, Simpson was acquitted of all criminal charges, a verdict that sparked intense debate and controversy as many continued to believe that he was responsible for Brown and Goldman’s murders. Despite his acquittal in the criminal trial, Simpson was later found liable for the deaths in a civil trial and ordered to pay millions in damages to the victims’ families.</p><p>In the aftermath of the trials, both Sydney and Justin have occasionally made headlines, but they have largely stayed out of the public eye. Understandably, all of his children have faced challenges associated with being the children of one of the most infamous figures in American legal history—including unfounded claims that one of them could be the real killer behind their mother’s murder. However, there is no credible evidence to suggest that any of his kids are responsible for Brown or Goldman’s deaths.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/oj-simpson-kids-nicole-brown.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/If-I-Did-It-OJ-Simpson.jpg><p>For more about OJ Simpson, you can read his 2008 memoir, <a data-pmc-sp-product=2395f9c7f17d32f846a85a0f729fe90f href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"If I Did It: Confessions of the Killer","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"If I Did It: Confessions of the Killer","price":"11.99","id":"0825305934","category":"Rich & Famous"},"id":1751769,"location":true}' custom-ga-track=click rel=nofollow>If I Did It: Confessions of the Killer</a> . Written by Simpson and told in his own words, the book takes readers through the former NFL star’s famous murder trial after the brutal 1995 murders of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ron Goldman, at her home in Brentwood, California. In the book, Simpson reveals how he would have committed the murders, under the pretense that his confession was “hypothetical.” A new edition of the book was published in 2007 and included essays written by members of the Goldman family, a member of the Goldman family legal team, and Simpson’s ghostwriter, revealing more details about his murder trial and his legal issues after Brown and Goldman’s murder. Journalist Barbara Walters described the memoir as “one of the most chilling things I have ever read.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2iblaGyo77IrbBmppWswHB9lm5ocG5pZLyredKipKmrn6N6rLXDrGSnoZOkuaZ5waumsKZf</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./sushi-not-japan-how-raw-fish-and-rice-became-world-favourite.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Did you know sushi didn't come from Japan?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-guild-theatre-menlo-parks-newest-concert-venue-to-debut-in-january.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The Guild Theatre, Menlo Parks Newest Concert Venue To Debut In January</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./20-year-sentence-2003-murder-ephrata-html.html>20-year sentence for 2003 murder in Ephrata</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./3-ways-can-remove-unwanted-blog-pages-google.html>3 Ways You Can Remove Unwanted Blog Pages From Google</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./5-rewarding-benefits-of-playing-the-violin.html>5 Rewarding Benefits of Playing the Violin</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./article-fbcffa51-ae5b-5b24-ba42-7821fc682093-html.html>Child molesters are the sweetest people | Columnists</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./woman-quells-racist-row-getting-boobs-train-html.html>Woman quells racist row by getting her boobs out on train</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaX.
