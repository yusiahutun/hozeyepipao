Bedsheets, towels, heavy-duty work clothes and other bulky items were placed in a large water-filled metal vat known as a “copper”, heated over a fire then scrubbed on a washboard with a bar of laundry soap before being wrung out through an electric or hand-operated mangle. These tasks were routine facts of life until not so long ago; in post-war Australia, my mother and aunts, now in their 80s and 90s, did all their laundry this way, well into their married lives.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The story of laundry is a fascinating part of Hong Kong’s social history. For many years, visitors to the colony who asked if there was a Hong Kong flag were wryly directed to the myriad washing poles that flapped from virtually every window in the city.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Chinese-run laundries have long been commonplace in many parts of the world. Across the diaspora, Chinese ethnic groups took up specific trades and occu­pations, and laundrymen, as well as carpenters, were mostly Cantonese, from San Francisco to Penang.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Chinese laundrymen were also employed on the merchant vessels of inter­national shipping firms such as P&O, the Glen Line and Blue Funnel Line, which plied routes between Britain and East Asia. For decades, the Royal Navy, too, engaged Chinese laundrymen as part of a ship’s company; recruited directly from Hong Kong, they served all over the world.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn4.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/05/11/c1eca720-51e4-11e8-a252-5c54534dd764_972x_125808.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Many Chinese emigrant families got a new start in life in the laundry business. A regular clientele was built up through quality of service and attention to detail – or swiftly eroded with loss or damage of garments and less than satisfactory results. This occupation offered an opportunity to an otherwise unskilled worker, and also provided work for members of his family. The more robust could do the washing, ironing and water carrying; folding and packing was under­taken by younger, older or physically weak­er family members; and smaller jobs could be delegated to children. A laundry also meant that for newcomers, limited or non-existent English (or what­ever the predominant local language happened to be) was not a barrier to eventual success.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Commercial laundries in Hong Kong became popular with families who other­wise did hand washing. Insufficient space at home to wash and dry larger items such as bedsheets, blankets, quilts and heavy garments was no longer a problem. A backstreet laundry would deal with these items efficiently and economically, and return them to a customer thoroughly cleaned and dried.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn4.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/05/11/c8061088-51e4-11e8-a252-5c54534dd764_1320x770_125808.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Laundries remain in demand in cities with high population densities and limited space in residential units, such as New York and Hong Kong. In recent years, as local apartments have steadily shrunk to “nano-flat” and “micro-unit” sizes, using the space occupied by a washing machine for other purposes has become commonplace, especially for those living alone or childless couples. Recourse to a laundry shop a few times a week, as an alternative to purchasing a washing machine, makes spatial as well as economic sense for many.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In older parts of Hong Kong, wooden washboards can still be bought from backstreet homeware shops. The fact that these items continue to be manufactured and offered for sale indicates that some people, at least, still use them.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuqKzwLOgp52jZL2wv9NmpJqfka%2B2r7GOrJ%2BoqqRiv6atw6xmmqqknrCtsY5raG1tZWeBcLTOsGShp56ceqy7zaBknrCgpL%2B1scNmmqGhnprApnnLmqynnKKueqK%2Bzq6lnQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./dawn-ward-not-real-housewives-24083767.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Why Dawn Ward is not on The Real Housewives of Cheshire series 13</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./thrive-causemetics-defying-gravity-moisturizer-review-7510555.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>My Foundation Looked Nearly Perfect for 10 Hours With This Moisturizer</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./20-year-sentence-2003-murder-ephrata-html.html>20-year sentence for 2003 murder in Ephrata</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./3-ways-can-remove-unwanted-blog-pages-google.html>3 Ways You Can Remove Unwanted Blog Pages From Google</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./5-rewarding-benefits-of-playing-the-violin.html>5 Rewarding Benefits of Playing the Violin</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./article-fbcffa51-ae5b-5b24-ba42-7821fc682093-html.html>Child molesters are the sweetest people | Columnists</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./woman-quells-racist-row-getting-boobs-train-html.html>Woman quells racist row by getting her boobs out on train</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaX.
