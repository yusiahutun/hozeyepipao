They have since withdrawn the request to see if a settlement can be worked out - but not before a wave of bad press portraying Belfort as a deadbeat.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"In some weird way, it probably helps the movie," he said in a recent phone interview. "It doesn't help me."</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The film - directed by Martin Scorsese and set for release on Christmas Day - chronicles the boyish, fast-talking Belfort's antics as chairman of Stratton Oakmont, the firm he started with a few desks and phones set up in a former Long Island car shop.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Stratton Oakmont made a fortune by using deceptive, high-pressure tactics to peddle penny stocks at inflated prices.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Belfort and his cronies ended up making more cash than they knew what to do with: a movie trailer shows a smirking DiCaprio crumpling up US$100 bills and throwing them in a waste basket.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Looking back, Belfort says becoming rich by deceit wasn't worth it. "Fraud is not something you want to be good at," he said. "I was always taking great efforts to cover my tracks. It was unbelievably exhausting, keeping track of all the lies. ... I think that's why I lived so recklessly."</p><a class="colorbox colorbox-insert-image euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/236w/public/2013/11/11/2748572cd0731fdd0d33292252f8f6f5.jpg></span></a>Belfort pleaded guilty in 1999 and agreed to become a government witness in a case against an accountant and other stock fraud defendants.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In 2003, after a broken marriage and a bout with drug addiction, Belfort was sentenced to 3 1/2 years in prison and ordered to chip away at the US$110 million restitution by giving 50 per cent of his future earnings to the government. Book sales resulted in payments of about US$700,000 from 2007 to 2009, court papers say.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But after completing probation in 2010, prosecutors claim Belfort's payments have slowed to a trickle - even after he made US$940,500 off the sale of the movie rights and continued to capitalise on his notoriety as a motivational speaker and business consultant.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Under those circumstances, it's not surprising that the government went on the offensive, said Marcos Jimenez, a former federal prosecutor.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"I think it's a little bit in-your-face when you write books and help make movies about your crimes, especially when the crimes are why you owe restitution," Jimenez said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In the interview, Belfort said he now can make tens of thousands of dollars for speaking engagements and other services.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As to his current problems with the law, Belfort's lawyers have argued that his obligation to pay half his earnings ended when he went off probation. Still, he claims he's repeatedly offered to pay 100 per cent of his book and movie profits and to negotiate a settlement on restitution, only to be met with silence.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"There's so much distrust," Belfort said of the prosecutors. "Most people lie to them. I don't want to make any money from the books or the movie. I don't think they could fathom that."</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Belfort bemoaning a lack of trust is outrageous, said Dianne Nygaard, a Kansas City, Missouri, lawyer who once represented some of his victims.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"No one should consider him trustworthy," Nygaard said of Belfort.
