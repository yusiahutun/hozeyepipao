number of nudist options are out there for those willing to let loose and go naked on beaches, bikes and beyond.</p><p>And, a naked tourism industry has sprung up around the desire to go clothes-free in both the UK and abroad.</p><p><b><a href=# rel=follow data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link data-content-type=news>READ MORE: Cabin crew share things passengers should never do on plane such as wearing shorts</a></b></p><p>In Spain, naturists can remove their clothes on plenty of sand beaches including the Vera Playa Naturist zone in Spain.</p><p>While in other areas in Spain going in the buff is frowned upon there is a “no swimsuit day” on many beaches in July – but, Vera lets you get your booty out 365 days a year.</p><img

travel website with an entire section dedicated to those Brits who are looking to bare all on their summer hols.</p><p>Described as “adult-only holidays where you can go naked if you wish”, the all-nude resorts and cruises include clothing optional areas.</p><p>And, people have been raving about their names holidays around the world – from bike rides to honeymoons.</p><p>Check out their experiences below…</p><h3>Nude honeymoon</h3><p>A couple who loves being fully naked decided to visit the largest “nudist city” in the word for their romantic honeymoon.</p><p>Cap D’Adge is a somewhat controversial French city by the seaside on the Mediterranean coast where people are permitted to live their lives fully nude.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article24473613.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_Couple.jpg><p><a href=# rel=follow data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link data-content-type=news>Arthur O Urso and Luana Kazaki</a> chose Cap D’Agde as the number one destination for their honeymoon.</p><p>They noted: “Couples should look for new experiences early in their marriage and not let it cool off!</p><p>“The city was elected the capital of sex and the experience is worth starting a marriage with adventures and new things, in addition to pleasure.</p><p>“We did this to get out of the sameness.”</p><p>Despite being a liberal city, which allows nudity, public sex is forbidden in Cap D’Adge.</p><p>You can be fined up to €15,000 (£12,860) if you are caught doing something inappropriate.</p><h3>Naked cycling</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

data-content-type=news>Colin Unsworth</a>, 52, and his cycling partner Sadie Tann, 32, were clapped along as they journeyed from John O’Groats to Lands End on a tandem.</p><p>Colin and Sadie embarked on the 50-mile-a-day journey to raise money for mental health charity Mind and Rewilding Britain, which aims to tackle climate emergency.</p><p>Colin explained: "I've been following the progress of Rewilding Britain and rewilding projects for a long time and I just think it is a fantastic thing that we should all be talking about.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article27522879.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/3_CouplejpgYou.jpg><p>"As naturists who are into nature connections and value mental health, we thought we can do some sort of stunt to raise awareness.</p><p>"The Rewilding Britain website says think 'big and act wild', well there's no bigger bike ride and it's a pretty wild day to do it."</p><p>It is not an offence to be naked in public in England and Wales, but it does become one if it can be proved a person stripped off with the intention to cause harassment, alarm or distress.</p><p>In terms of reaction from the public, "the vast majority of people beep and wave, video and smile".</p><p>"They say we've got some bottle," Colin said. "It's generally positive."</p><h3>No Clothes Festival</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article27448934.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/2_2JPG.jpg><p>Social media star Kate, known as <a href=# rel=nofollow>@fullplatekate</a> on <a href=# data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link data-content-type=section-topic>Instagram</a>, took to the site to share her experiences from Nudefest.</p><p><a href=# rel=nofollow>Nudefest</a> which takes place in Somerset, is the UK’s largest naturist festival, where 600 people spend the week starkers as they enjoy a range of entertainment and activities.</p><p>Talking about the event, Kate, who is known for her <a href=# data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link data-content-type=section-topic>body positive</a> posts, admitted she found it "empowering".</p><p>Opening up to her 13,400 followers, the social media star said: "Being naked was remarkably empowering.</p><p>"I saw so many bodies. Completely unique, and ALL beautiful.</p><p>"I loved being around people who seemed to be so confident and carefree. It made me realise that a body is just a body. It's a vessel that we live inside of."</p><p>She added: "Also, EVERYONE had cellulite. This might not be your cup of tea, and to be honest, I didn't think it was mine.</p><p>"However, today has helped me with my deepest most subconscious body-image issues. I have been able to let go of that fear of judgement from others. Because really, who actually cares?"</p><p>She added: "I'm home from Nudefest with a changed attitude to nakedness!"</p><p><b>READ NEXT:</b></p><ul><li><p><a href=# rel=follow data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link data-content-type=news><b>Mum explains how she bagged five-star holiday for £1.40 – and you can too</b></a></p></li><li><p><a href=# rel=follow data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link data-content-type=news><b>Bride tried to 'shut down' beach and kick people out of the sea for wedding snaps</b></a></p></li><li><p><a href=# rel=follow data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link data-content-type=news><b>'I'm travelling around South America and funding it by filming myself having sex'</b></a></p></li><li><p><a href=# rel=follow data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link data-content-type=news><b>Sunbed hoggers enraged by staff removing towels at five-star Tenerife hotel</b></a></p></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCsrJGne6S7ja6iaKyilsOmuI6tqZqulaF6r7HWrGapnZ%2BluaZ50qGYq51dqMGwvsieqmampZm2tMCMoaaloZSWxrR5kXBsa2pobYQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./palmares-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Palmars Copa del Rey - Todos los campeones y finalistas</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./eastern-us-residents-spot-rare-red-flanked-bluetail-bird-for-the-first-time.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Eastern US Residents Spot Rare Red-Flanked Bluetail Bird for the First Time</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./20-year-sentence-2003-murder-ephrata-html.html>20-year sentence for 2003 murder in Ephrata</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./3-ways-can-remove-unwanted-blog-pages-google.html>3 Ways You Can Remove Unwanted Blog Pages From Google</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./5-rewarding-benefits-of-playing-the-violin.html>5 Rewarding Benefits of Playing the Violin</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./article-fbcffa51-ae5b-5b24-ba42-7821fc682093-html.html>Child molesters are the sweetest people | Columnists</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./woman-quells-racist-row-getting-boobs-train-html.html>Woman quells racist row by getting her boobs out on train</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaX.
