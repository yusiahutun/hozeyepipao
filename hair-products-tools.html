Sadly, we are not one of those people — we need all the help with our hair, which runs the extreme on both ends of the spectrum: Greasy roots and dry strands. But the <strong>oil-absorbing powders</strong> of this <strong>charcoal-based dry shampoo</strong> work <strong>so instantly and so fully</strong> that two puffs is all you need. <strong>We never had to cake it on</strong> for our hair to <strong>look perfect and deceptively clean</strong>, and since three of our editors have jet-black or deep espress-hued hair, this made a huge difference.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It absorbed with lighting fast speed — sometimes it disappeared into our hair before we had even put the bottle down after applying. Nor did we have to excessively rub it in since there was no white cast or residue to blend, which earned it another gold star, given that our hair is highly reactive and prone to frizz with even the slightest bit of friction. Our <strong>matte, volumized roots</strong> also looked <strong>clean as a whistle</strong> for a <strong>shockingly long period of time</strong>, not just surviving, but thriving, through sweaty sessions at the gym and up to<strong> three days without needing a touch-up</strong>. Yet one of our favorite things about this Briogeo product is that it doesn’t try to do too much — the<strong> lightweight texture felt amazing</strong> in our hair, gave <strong>our roots a boost</strong> without going overboard with disco-ready full bodied volume, and the <strong>subtle scent was pleasant and lowkey</strong>.

The powder effortlessly dissolves into the hair without leaving behind any residue and the brown tint ensures even the darkest of hair won't have that unwanted ghostly cast. And because it's a non-aerosol powder instead of a spray, it's<strong> easier to control</strong> where it goes, so you can apply as much or as little as you'd like to areas that need a refresh.

We added bonus points for the extra bit of<strong> lift and volume boost</strong> it gave us.

However, that is not to say that you can’t use dry shampoo on curly hair, but it’s important to keep in mind that coily textures are prone to dryness, and need an extra dose of oil to retain moisture, so look for a formula with hydration-replenishing ingredients, like coconut oil and vitamin E.</li><li><strong>Ingredients: </strong>The main purpose of dry shampoo is to “absorb or prevent oil at the root so that you can extend any style,” says celebrity hairstylist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nocaes>Alex Brown</a>, which is accomplished through ingredients such as <strong>clay, silica, zeolite, oatmeal, or starches</strong>. Additionally, you can seek out products with <strong>natural antimicrobial ingredients</strong>, like essential oils and fruit extracts, that will keep oil-causing bacteria at bay and curb the growth of bacteria on scalps that lead to greasy strands.</li><li><strong>Formula:</strong> Dry ry shampoos typically come in a<strong>erosols, powders, serums, mists, and even mousses</strong>. Personally, Brown recommends “an aerosol dry shampoo because it’s usually lighter than a powder,” and adds that while “there are other types of dry shampoo that can be used at the root to add some volume,I find an aerosol helps avoid residue and has styling benefits.” As for the other types of dry shampoos, Brown mentions that “a serum or mist could be helpful if in a pinch after a workout, and a mousse could help to keep curls hydrated while getting the oil-absorbing benefits.”</li><li><strong>Scent: </strong>Make sure to pay attention to whether or not a product is scented, especially if you have a sensitive scalp. If you’re someone who struggles with scalp sensitivity, Brown recommends using dry shampoo sparingly. “You should be able to use dry shampoo but it’s probably best to only use it one day and not multiple days.” You can also choose to opt for dry shampoos that are unscented to avoid irritation that fragrances can often cause. er types of dry shampoo that can be used at the root to add some volume. For example, a serum or mist could be great after a workout, and a mousse could help to keep curls hydrated while still getting the oil-absorbing benefits.</li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-questions-answered></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Your Questions, Answered</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Is dry shampoo bad for your hair?&nbsp;</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While dry shampoos themselves are not damaging — like most beauty products — they should be <strong>used in moderation</strong>. "Dry shampoos are designed to help lengthen the time between shampoos, but they should be used only once between wash days, and preferably only once a week," master stylist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="nofollow nocaes">Gregga Prothero</a> says. "If you continually apply it every day it can cause build up that clogs the pores on your scalp and leads to poor hair health."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">As for other downsides, some dry shampoos cause a bit of white cast residue, but Tricomi tells us that, “preventing a white cast on the hair is as simple as ensuring it is rubbed into the hair well.” Brown adds that because using dry shampoo can cause build up over time, it’s essential to cleanse your hair regularly to make sure to avoid any excess product in your hair. “I recommend adding a weekly detox shampoo if you use dry shampoo regularly to remove any build up,” she says, adding that it’s important to incorporate real shampoo into your hair because at the end of the day, dry shampoo isn’t a replacement, it’s a temporary fix used to get you through wash days. “Dry shampoo is a styling product that doesn’t clean the hair or scalp, so proper cleaning of the hair and scalp is necessary as it helps keep it healthy,” says Brown</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How do you use dry shampoo?&nbsp;</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The first step in applying a dry shampoo is to make sure your hair is completely dry. According to Prothero, any wetness "can mix with the dry shampoo and cause some buildup." She also recommends not spraying it directly onto your part and instead "lifting the hair on both sides of your part and then spraying the dry shampoo at the temple, sideburns, and slightly below the crown area."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Prothero emphasizes that it is best to focus on the areas that get weighed down easily by oil. Brown agrees, adding that: “You really want to massage the product into the hair with your fingers, a blow dryer, or both. It’s important to evenly distribute the product to get the best result.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">As for how often, Brown recommends using dry shampoo on day two or three to help freshen hair. After day three, it will most likely be time to wash your hair with a cleansing shampoo. “You can use it for two or three days, but you will probably start to see and feel build up in your hair after that,” Brown adds.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Can you use dry shampoo every day?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">How often you use a dry shampoo will depend on your specific hair type, how greasy your hair gets, and how many times you wash your hair per week. "If your hair tends to get oily quickly, then you should apply the dry shampoo once your hair has completely dried after a shampoo," says Prothero. "Doing this prevents the hair from getting too limp and greasy throughout the day," she adds.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">&nbsp;Additionally, Prothero says that "for hair textures that need more moisture and tend to be on the drier side, I'd apply the dry shampoo 2-3 days after your shampoo, so some natural oils can be distributed in the hair."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-shop-with-us></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Shop With Us</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Irene Richardson</a> is a beauty and fashion writer at InStyle.
