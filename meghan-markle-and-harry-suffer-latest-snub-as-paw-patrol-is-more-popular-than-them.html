The Sussexes’ £88 million Netflix series was recently overshadowed by children’s shows Paw Patrol and Peppa Pig. It comes as the streaming giant released their Top Ten Series list by hours.</strong></p><p>After receiving significant backlash for being secretive about the viewing figures for its shows, <a href=#>Netflix</a> has released a list of its top shows of 2023. This is based on the hours viewers watch, which sets the streamer apart from other analytics. However, two kids shows namely Paw Patrol and Peppa Pig have raked in bigger numbers than <a href=#>Meghan Markle</a> and Harry’s secret-spilling docuseries. The numbers add insult on top of injury as this year has proven to be a whirlwind year for the <a href=#>Prince Harry</a> and the duchess.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/10/Screenshot-2023-10-11-at-13.04.00-1024x577.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-paw-patrol-is-more-popular-than-meghan-and-harry-s-docuseries>Paw Patrol is more popular than Meghan and Harry’s docuseries</h2><p>Harry & Meghan on Netflix has six episodes which are approximately one hour each. However, despite releasing six hours’ worth of content as a part of their $100 million Netflix deal, their show has only raked in 62 million viewing hours. This is from the streaming giant’s list they published today.</p><p>Their show was beaten by two kids shows. One of them, namely Peppa Pig, landed at the 211th spot on the list. It’s first two seasons have earned more than 140 million hours combined.&nbsp;Moreover, another one – Paw Patrol’s sixth season alone – has raked in 149 million hours&nbsp;in views.</p><p>For the unversed, 60 million hours worth of views means maybe ten million people have watched a one-hour episode of a show once.</p><p>Although, it’s hard to measure up. Because that would account to more people living in the entire United Kingdom, sitting down to tune in to the Duke and Duchess. Every viewing minute is counted, so people who watched it twice would still count to the total.</p><p>It’s hard to know if 60 million people watched the series, or say, 20 million viewers sat down to watch it three times.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-14-at-7.41.35-PM-1024x541.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-night-agent-and-other-successful-shows-on-the-top-list>The Night Agent and other successful shows on the top list</h2><p>For those wondering which show has scored the top position on the exhausting list. It’s the first season of political thriller The Night Agent, which raked in 812 million in just three months. The second season of Ginny and Georgia has ranked 2nd on the list with 665 million hours worth of views.</p><p>Korean revenge thriller The Glory is number 3 with 623 million hours.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-meghan-markle-and-prince-harry-also-named-biggest-losers>Meghan Markle and Prince Harry also named ‘biggest losers’</h2><p>Besides Netflix, The Hollywood Reporter <a href=# rel=nofollow>released</a> a list casting the Duke and Duchess of Sussex in a rather bad light.</p><p>Their annual winners and losers list is out, and it wasn’t a great time for the <a href=#>royals</a>. The brutally honest rundown of who in entertainment had the best year and who had the worst one names&nbsp;<a href=#>Taylor Swift</a>&nbsp;as a winner. Greta Gerwig and Margot Robbie also made it on the winner’s list.</p><p>However, Meghan and Harry were named as losers in the list. The outlet noted how South Park’s dig at the Sussexes acted like a pin for their “sanctimonious bubble.” The show aired a 20-minute segment named “World-Wide Privacy Tour” in March 2023. It surely dealt a huge blow to the Sussexes’ public image around the world.</p><p>Later, the former royals’ podcast Archetypes was dropped by <a href=#>Spotify</a> following which a top executive of the company <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">labeled them</a> as “grifters.”</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmpqX2aBcLnEoJ%2Bapl2irrO3y55kmqaUYrWivtGyZKytlpuys3nLmqueq6RiwK%2FBwWaYrGWglsRuvMCtqaikXZ7AbrnOq5xmqJ%2Blwq2t0WaroZmeYsGpscxo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./zell-swag-age-gay-boyfriend-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Why Zell Swag Age 30 Isn't Gay Despite Dating, Having Boyfriend History</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./howard-hewett-and-rainey-riley-cunningham.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Howard Hewett and Rainey Riley-cunningham</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./20-year-sentence-2003-murder-ephrata-html.html>20-year sentence for 2003 murder in Ephrata</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./3-ways-can-remove-unwanted-blog-pages-google.html>3 Ways You Can Remove Unwanted Blog Pages From Google</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./5-rewarding-benefits-of-playing-the-violin.html>5 Rewarding Benefits of Playing the Violin</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./article-fbcffa51-ae5b-5b24-ba42-7821fc682093-html.html>Child molesters are the sweetest people | Columnists</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./woman-quells-racist-row-getting-boobs-train-html.html>Woman quells racist row by getting her boobs out on train</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaX.
