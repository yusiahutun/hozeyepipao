The duke shows the post to wife <a href=#>Meghan Markle,</a> who can only muster one word as she reads it. It came after the <a href=#>royals</a>‘ tell-all sit down chat with Oprah, which reports said caused a rift between the siblings. But, it’s clear Harry’s response in the <a href=#>Netflix</a> documentary, was telling.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-prince-harry-s-emotional-reaction-to-william-s-text>Prince Harry’s emotional reaction to William’s text</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/08/GettyImages-1233756688-1024x682.jpg><p>In the hit documentary, which was the streaming site’s most popular to date, we see the royal parents sitting in Meghan’s office. In the show Harry & Meghan, the pair talk through the unexpected aftermath of their explosive interview with billionaire Oprah.</p><p>Meghan, speaking to friend Tyler Perry, we see Harry emerge showing his phone screen to his beloved wife.</p><p>The Duchess says out loud: “H just got a text… H just got a text from his brother.”</p><p>She simply uttered “wow”, in disbelief at the text from William to Prince Harry. Then Harry’s response was crushing to fans.</p><p>He truthfully revealed: “I wish I knew what to do”. The dad-of-two lifts his arms in disbelief, emotionally, as Meghan stands up to embrace him.</p><p>The Suits actor could see what it was doing to the former veteran and suggested: “I know. Let’s take a breather. Get some air and then decide”.</p><p>Watch the devastating moment below:</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-royal-rift-between-the-two-princes>Royal rift between the two princes</h2><p>It was clear that the moment was the tip of the iceberg for what the family had been going through. The first inklings that the brothers were <a href=# rel=nofollow>drifting apart</a> came in 2019, when Harry said himself that they were on ‘different paths’.</p><p>He said on their African tour and documentary: “Look, we’re brothers, we’ll always be brothers. And we’re certainly on different paths at the moment, but I’ll always be there for him, as I know he’ll always be there for me.”</p><p>However, what was actually said in the text from <a href=#>Prince William</a> to Harry has never been revealed. It wasn’t shown in the <a href=#>TV</a> documentary, but it quickly moved on.</p><p>But it’s something fans picked up on.</p><p>Other viewers were skeptical it happened as it did on camera.</p><p>“Lucky, there was a camera crew around at the exact time Prince William texts Hazza,” one <a href=#>Twitter</a> user wrote.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-dealing-with-the-aftermath>Dealing with the aftermath</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/08/GettyImages-666508844-1024x697.jpg><p>The Sussexes’ stepped down as senior royals in 2020, and the following year sat down with Oprah. They made a series of bombshell allegations against The Firm. They didn’t put <a href=#>King Charles</a>, wife Camilla and others in a good light as fans tried to decode what they were saying.</p><p>Viewers jumped to conclusions after Meghan and Harry alleged a conversation arose over what Archie’s skin color would be when he was born. But the pair quickly <a href=# rel=nofollow>spoke out</a> and vehemently denied <a href=#>Queen Elizabeth II</a> and Prince Philip were not behind this, and said they would never say who it was.</p><p>Following the chat, Prince William and the royal family responded to the claims. The Prince of Wales, the next in line to the British throne, explicitly told reporters the royal family were not racists, following backlash. They said they would deal with it privately as a family and said Harry and Meghan were always valued members.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmlwX2aEcLzRoqWcnV2drrO%2B2KxknKqlqLWqusZmqp6ulaN6uLvRnWSrnaOlvK%2B%2FxGaYn6yVp3qzscCdoKefXay2rbjImqSsZaSaxbV7</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./twilight-inside-bella-swans-absolutely-gorgeous-home-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Inside Bella Swans Absolutely Gorgeous Home</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./martin-landau-and-gretchen-becker.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Martin Landau and Gretchen Becker</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./20-year-sentence-2003-murder-ephrata-html.html>20-year sentence for 2003 murder in Ephrata</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./3-ways-can-remove-unwanted-blog-pages-google.html>3 Ways You Can Remove Unwanted Blog Pages From Google</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./5-rewarding-benefits-of-playing-the-violin.html>5 Rewarding Benefits of Playing the Violin</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./article-fbcffa51-ae5b-5b24-ba42-7821fc682093-html.html>Child molesters are the sweetest people | Columnists</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./woman-quells-racist-row-getting-boobs-train-html.html>Woman quells racist row by getting her boobs out on train</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaX.
