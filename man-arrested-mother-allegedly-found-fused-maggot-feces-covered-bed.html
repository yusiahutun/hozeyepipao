Peering in the windows, they saw trash piled up and flies on the windows. Due to the potentially hazardous living conditions inside the home and the lack of response, police forced entry into the residence.</p><p>Inside, they made contact with Klein amid more trash and food packages, partially blocking the front entryway and making it so the door would be difficult to open, per the release. They also noticed what was described as a "foul odor."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:f86bcaa9-25ce-4855-9d21-5f65794f9946 data-container-ref=toofab:article:27b44461-d978-44bb-abc7-1701bdbf246e data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/f7/5by4/2024/02/06/f7bea8b5ecf049ada868a91308f66f6d_xs.png width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">WAFB / Facebook</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Parents of Woman Found 'Melted' to Sofa Are Sentenced In Horrifying Case</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Upon request, Klein took them back to his mother's room, where they found her lying on the bed unconscious but breathing. Officers noted the blanket on top of her was soiled. At that point, EMS was called to the scene.</p><p>It was the EMS responders who removed the blanket, revealing an even more horrifying situation. According to the release, the woman's lower half was "covered in dried feces and maggots," and she had what police described as "ram's horn toenails."</p><p>Even worse, upon examination, it was discovered that Klein's unconscious mother was "fused" to the bed sheets.</p><p>"This is one of the worst cases I've seen in my four years as district attorney here," Deleware County DA Jack Stollsteimer told Philadelphia's <a href=#><strong>WPVI</strong></a>. "And for this person, the defendant Klein, to do this to his own mother, it's just -- I can't even imagine."</p><p>Both Klein and his mother were transported to the hospital where Klein was subsequently arrested. He was charged with abuse of a dependent person and recklessly endangering another person, per <a href=#><strong>Law & Crime</strong></a>. Klein is being held on ten percent of a $50,000 bail.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3V7j21mamhfoq6vecCrqZ6rpJqxbrnOrZ%2Beql2Wua2xxp6bpbFdm7y2usNmna6rlZl6rq3GoKatZZaasKa%2FjJymr52imrFursSdZg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./best-raspberry-pi-cyberdecks.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The 5 Best Raspberry Pi Cyberdecks</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./5901c37c22601dbc348b45ba-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Las tres ventajas de Conor McGregor para derrotar a Mayweather</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./20-year-sentence-2003-murder-ephrata-html.html>20-year sentence for 2003 murder in Ephrata</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./3-ways-can-remove-unwanted-blog-pages-google.html>3 Ways You Can Remove Unwanted Blog Pages From Google</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./5-rewarding-benefits-of-playing-the-violin.html>5 Rewarding Benefits of Playing the Violin</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./article-fbcffa51-ae5b-5b24-ba42-7821fc682093-html.html>Child molesters are the sweetest people | Columnists</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./woman-quells-racist-row-getting-boobs-train-html.html>Woman quells racist row by getting her boobs out on train</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaX.
