Inspired by the likes of the Kinks and the Rolling Stones,&nbsp;the band quickly evolved from a garage-based cover band to a popular punk and rock and roll force to reckon with.&nbsp;</p><p>The digital age has brought a new wave of fans for the Goo Goo Dolls. Platforms like TikTok have younger generations rediscovering and covering the band’s classic hits like ‘Iris’ and ‘Slide.’ This newfound popularity is evident as ‘Iris’ recently celebrated a milestone by reaching a billion streams on Spotify.</p><p><a data-amazonimages title="Greatest Hits Volume One - The Singles" href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41ZF3QScgKL._SL500_.jpg alt="Greatest Hits Volume One - The Singles" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto title="Here is what we know about John Rzeznik's plastic surgery 2"></a></p><p>Front man John Rzeznik is arguably the most recognizable of all the band’s members. Not only is he the group’s founder, lead vocalist, and guitarist, but he’s also the most ageless of them all!</p><p>Despite being in his mid-fifties, the Goo Goo Dolls’ lead singer looks his age and would be confused for a 30-year-old. Over the years, there have been relentless rumors about Johnny Rzeznik going under the knife, but he’s never responded to the allegations.</p><p>John Rzeznik’s <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://7news.com.au/video/entertainment/goo-goo-dolls-release-new-music-ahead-of-australian-tour-bc-6331899031112 rel="nofollow noopener">latest appearance</a> on Seven’s The Morning Show left many fans and viewers in awe.

The group gained early success, and Johnny quickly became a sensation among fans for his vocal prowess but also for his outstanding alternate guitar tunings.</p><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100% rel="noopener nofollow">View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none rel="noopener nofollow">A post shared by Goo Goo Dolls (@googoodollsofficial)</a></p><p>Having garnered so much international fame, it was inevitable that Rzeznik’s looks would come under the spotlight. Johnny’s facial appearance has changed dramatically over the years and many have wondered about the number and types of plastic surgeries the famous vocalist has undergone.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Goo Goo Dolls Leader Singer Plastic Surgery: Did Johnny Rzeznik Go Under the Knife?</h2><p>There is no doubt that Johnny has had some work done on his face. Unlike some celebrities who are vocal or at least acknowledge going under the knife, Rzeznik has remained mum about the rumors surrounding his changing looks.&nbsp;</p><p>The truth is, we will likely never know the amount of plastic surgery the lead singer has undergone since he achieved global fame many years ago. But, there is no denying the fact that pictures of him from 10 years ago and today are drastically different if you look closely.&nbsp;</p><p><a data-amazonimages title="Notebook : John Rzeznik Notebook Great for Birthday and Fan , Thankgiving Notebook - Idea for Father Day, Mother Day #258" href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41yax8qbEyL._SL500_.jpg alt="Notebook : John Rzeznik Notebook Great for Birthday and Fan , Thankgiving Notebook - Idea for Father Day, Mother Day #258" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto title="Here is what we know about John Rzeznik's plastic surgery 4"></a></p><p>Yes, everyone looks different over the years. But some differences are so significant, that you can’t help but wonder whether aside from normal aging, they did something else to alter their appearance. This is the case with John Rzeznik!</p><p>Despite being well into his mid-fifties, the popular musician doesn’t look any older than a man in his 40s. The recovering alcoholic has reportedly done a lot to live a clean and healthy life, which has somewhat helped with his ageless looks.&nbsp;</p><p>Aside from quitting the bottle and being sober for a couple of years, he has in the past claimed that he turned to meditation, yoga, and healthy eating. Still, it is obvious that John Rzeznik has had plastic surgery to maintain a youthful look.&nbsp;</p><p>As mentioned, there is no way to know how much plastic surgery he has done. But, we are talking about several nose jobs, cheekbone restructuring, and some work on the jawline and chin. There is also no doubt that the Goo Goo Dolls’ lead singer has had numerous facelifts.&nbsp;</p><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100% rel="noopener nofollow">View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none rel="noopener nofollow">A post shared by Goo Goo Dolls (@googoodollsofficial)</a></p><p>Even though Rzeznik doesn’t say much about the plastic surgery rumors, you don’t need to be a Holywood aficionado to see his changing looks over the years.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>John Rzeznik Botched Plastic Surgery</h2><p>Before the plastic surgery, John Rzeznik had a naturally wide-set nose. Unfortunately, a pointed nose seems to be the acceptable standard in Hollywood and that’s what Rzeznik aimed for.&nbsp;</p><p>Obsessed with his looks, the lead singer began with a subtle nose job before doing more elaborate work on his facial appearance. Rumors have it that he probably did a rhinoplasty procedure to get a more pointy nose. A look at his early pictures and his most recent ones reveal a stark difference, pointing to an obvious nose job.&nbsp;</p><p>John’s chin also looks slightly different from how it used to during his younger days. The chances are good that he has undergone chin augmentation in the form of mentoplasty and genioplasty. Both procedures result in a more chiseled jawline and chin, another Hollywood beauty standard that many a celebrity seeks to attain.</p><p>It is also clear that Rzeznik has received botox injections to maintain a youthful look. But, a keen observe will notice that his agelessness has come at a cost. For one, his face looks quite artificial and it is also drained of all color, leaving him with a yothful but superficial look for all it is worth.</p><p>We’ve seen from many celebrities that<a href=# data-type=post data-id=972> plastic surgery doesn’t always go right</a>. In fact having too much work done can leave one looking worse than they did before the procedure.&nbsp;</p><p>Even though it is clear that Rzeznik has had quite a number of cosmetic procedures done, he’s been lucky that his looks haven’t drastically changed for the worse.</p><p>In the early years, when he began performing plastic surgery, the work he’d done to alter his appearance was very subtle and barely noticeable. But, the more work he does over the years, the more noticeable the difference in his appearance is.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Johnny Rzeznik Before and After Plastic Surgery</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.glossyfied.com/file/2023/09/john-rzeznik-plastic-surgery-rumours-1024x536.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Where Is Johnny Rzeznik Now?</h2><p>Thirty five years since the making of Goo Goo Dolls, John Rzeznik and his band are still going strong, making music and navigating the demands of their own personal lives.&nbsp;</p><p>Rzeznik has recovered from alcoholism and is proudly living a sober life.
