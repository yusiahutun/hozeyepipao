Big time," said King. "My wife threatened to divorce me. I played that a lot."</p><p>"I had the dance mix," he continued. "I loved those extended play things and I played both sides of it. And one of them was just total instrumental. And I played that thing until my wife just said, 'One more time, and I'm going to f---ing leave you.'"</p><p>King revealed that this occurred while he was writing 11/22/63, which released in 2011. And while he must not listen to "Mambo No. 5" as obsessively as before, as the pair are still married, the author did divulge some of his other listening habits for writing.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:9b425605-6cb2-4b87-8166-cef33f1d85cd data-container-ref=toofab:article:5160d326-772d-4aab-a2e2-bdcc9b7ecb14 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/c6/5by4/2022/11/01/c697e419424b4af5904f0aa69653a211_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Elon Musk Responds to Stephen King Slamming Blue Check Mark Plan</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"When I write, there are things that I can listen to a lot," said King. "And a lot of it is techno or disco stuff, but techno in particular. There's this group called LCD Soundsystem, and I love that. Fatboy Slim is somebody else. I can just listen to that stuff."</p><p>"If you tried to write and listen to Leonard Cohen, how the f--k would you do that?" continued King. "Because you'd have to listen to the words and you'd have to listen to what he's saying. But with some of the techno stuff, or KC and the Sunshine Band, Gloria Gaynor, it's all good."</p><p>"Lately, I think that I've been sort of stuck on Foghat and Bob Seger, people like that," he said of his recent music taste. "But I've also been listening to a fair amount of country music. So a lot of Travis Tritt and Alan Jackson, people like that."</p><p>King's latest novel, Holly, hit the shelves earlier this week.</p><a id=gallery-link-ee4329ff-6f92-47ad-9f14-943825c4770f class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:ee4329ff-6f92-47ad-9f14-943825c4770f data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:5160d326-772d-4aab-a2e2-bdcc9b7ecb14 data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/92/4by3/2023/09/06/92303adbb8c4423b9442f90def6241e1_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7j3JmaXBfqMGmvMeepWajmaO0tHnWop2eZaSWr6rAx5pkmqSdpMC1ecOiraiqk5qxbrTIpmSorpWneq6tzJumZqafYoJw</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./luxury-watch-alternatives-to-rolex-milgauss.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The Rolex Milgauss is discontinued: Here's 7 luxury watches under 5000 you should buy instead - sh</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./princess-rajwa-jordan-blossoming-baby-bump-unexpected-denim-jumpsuit.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Pregnant Princess Rajwa displays blossoming baby bump in unexpected denim jumpsuit</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./20-year-sentence-2003-murder-ephrata-html.html>20-year sentence for 2003 murder in Ephrata</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./3-ways-can-remove-unwanted-blog-pages-google.html>3 Ways You Can Remove Unwanted Blog Pages From Google</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./5-rewarding-benefits-of-playing-the-violin.html>5 Rewarding Benefits of Playing the Violin</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./article-fbcffa51-ae5b-5b24-ba42-7821fc682093-html.html>Child molesters are the sweetest people | Columnists</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./woman-quells-racist-row-getting-boobs-train-html.html>Woman quells racist row by getting her boobs out on train</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaX.
