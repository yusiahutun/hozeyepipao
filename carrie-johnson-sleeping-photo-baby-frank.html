She explained: " It is common for babies to wake up frequently throughout the night, especially if they have been helped to sleep through feeding or rocking.&nbsp;</p><p id=ePHSVp5hgOb data-wc=45>The way they fall asleep initially is usually how they prefer to go back to sleep after completing sleep cycles. It is important to ensure that the amount of sleep in 24 hours is sufficient for your baby, which depends on their age and temperament.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/9ee1bc808bed-snapinstaapp4186219637256882562211672579872965400285549n1284.jpg><p id=ekYXX7hWrwN data-wc=52>"Every family is different, so there is no one-size-fits-all approach to sleep, but there are gentle methods available to improve sleep and resolve challenges. It is crucial to consider both how they fall asleep and the amount of sleep they are getting in order to address wake-ups at night and short naps."</p><p id=eDthZXoX8Bd data-wc=53>We also called on baby sleep consultant <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Rachael Finlay, founder of Little Baby Sleep Co</a>, who explained: "There will be hundreds of parents who can relate to Carrie’s experience because it’s frustrating common for babies this age to struggle with frequent night waking especially if they are fully assisted to sleep at bedtime.</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Carrie Johnson shares adorable 'celebratory' photo of daughter Romy following first day of nursery" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/5b6708d17e05-carrie-johnson.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Carrie Johnson shares adorable 'celebratory' photo of daughter Romy following first day of nursery" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Carrie Johnson shares adorable 'celebratory' photo of daughter Romy following first day of nursery</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><p id=en4oICyAfx data-wc=53>" The good news is you absolutely don’t need to leave your baby to 'cry it out' to achieve that.
