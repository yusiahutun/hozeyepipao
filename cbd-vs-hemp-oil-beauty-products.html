If you've heard about CBD, you likely know that it's derived from the same plant as marijuana, but the hemp plant has a lot of powerful derivatives that may pop up on your vanity and it's good to know what to use when.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>CBG</a>, for example, is essentially the Rolls Royce of cannabinoids. There's also <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Delta-8 THC,</a> which is known as the "light" weed and is popping up in products such as bath bombs. And we can't forget about the ever-popular hemp seed oil, obviously.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you're confused, you're not alone. So we spoke to two experts to break down everything there is to know about CBD and hemp seed oil for your skin, as they're often used interchangeably in beauty products. Read below to find out more.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-is-cbd></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Is CBD?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In very simple terms, CBD is a compound found in cannabis plants. "It's one of the two primary active ingredients of cannabis, the other one being THC — tetrahydrocannabinol — which is the active psychotropic ingredient," explains <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Nina Desai, MD</a>, a New York-based dermatologist.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">CBD is non-psychoactive, which means it won't get you high. What it can do, however, is reduce stress and anxiety when ingested, and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>studies</a> show that when applied topically, it can reduce inflammation caused by psoriasis and eczema. It also neutralizes redness and reduces pain, and since it's such a good moisturizer, Dr. Desai says it combats dryness and itchiness.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The extraction process is interesting, as well. "When you press the entire cannabis plant, including the stalk, leaves, and flowers, a specific compound called CBD is present. Extracting and preparing the oil that specifically isolates and concentrates the CBD to produce a form of CBD oil often called Pure CBD Oil," explains Bruno Schiavi, co-founder of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Uncle Bud's</a>. "CBD oil is then added to various products ranging from sublingual drops to skincare products."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-is-hemp-seed-oil></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Is Hemp Seed Oil?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Schiavi explains that, unlike CBD, hemp oil is the botanical oil extracted from the seed of the cannabis hemp plant. So, while it has very similar properties to CBD, there are a few key differences. "It's full of beneficial compounds like amino acids, vitamins, antioxidants, and omega 3s," he adds.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In skincare, Dr. Desai says that hemp oil can help moisturize the skin and repair the skin barrier. Additionally, she says it acts as a humectant and draws water into the skin. "Hemp seed oil can also help regulate the skin's oil production, which can help those with acne," she adds.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And like CBD, the benefits of hemp oil don't stop there. "It's also is part of a 'holistic' or whole-body wellness strategy that seeks to achieve overall health through nutrition, exercise, recreation, and self-care," says Schiavi.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>VIDEO: CBG — the 'Mother of All Cannabinoids' — Is Taking Over Beauty, and It May Be Even Better for Your Skin</strong></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-are-there-any-side-effects-that-can-come-from-using-cbd-or-hemp-skincare></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Are There Any Side Effects That Can Come From Using CBD or Hemp Skincare?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Dr. Desai says that there are no known side effects from using topical CBD or hemp products. "However, as with any new product, if a rash or irritation develops, it's best to discontinue the product as you may be sensitive or allergic to one of the ingredients," she adds.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-whats-the-best-way-to-choose-which-one-is-right-for-you></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What's The Best Way to Choose Which One Is Right For You?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"CBD oil is essentially identical to hemp seed oil, the only difference is CBD oil is prepared to purposely isolate the CBD," says Schiavi. "Both CBD oil and hemp seed oil contain therapeutic compounds that can benefit your skin, such as natural moisturizers, amino acids, omegas, and vitamins."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">So where does that leave us?</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Remember, CBD has many anti-inflammatory properties and can support pain relief. Hemp oil is known for its softening benefits. So, it depends which concern you want to address the most. If you want the benefits of both, know that there are many products that contain both CBD and hemp seed oil.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For example, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Saint Jane's Luxury Beauty Serum</a> marries the ingredients and throws in a handful of radiance-boosting botanicals for clear, glowy skin. For CBD-only, allow us to recommend <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Uncle Bud's 5mg CBD Lip Balm</a>, which reduces the pain of chapped lips. And for super-soft skin, we love <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel=nofollow>Herbivore's Emerald Deep Moisture Glow</a> which is packed with hemp oil and makes skin supple and soft.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">From non-toxic makeup and skincare to sustainability practices, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Clean Slate</a> is an exploration of all things in the green beauty space.
