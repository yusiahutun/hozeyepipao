Throughout the song, the lyrics explore the idea of others hating and plotting against them due to their success and status, leading to a sense of jealousy and resentment. While the primary theme of the song is jealousy, there are several standout lyrics that help develop different secondary themes within the song.One notable lyric that stands out in "Jealousy" is when Takeoff raps, "Vegetarian shooter, he gon' kill 'bout that celery." This line, although unexpected, develops a theme of hypocrisy and deception. The metaphor of a vegetarian shooter implies that someone who claims to be peaceful or nonviolent can still have the capability to harm others. It serves as a reminder that people's actions may not always align with their outward appearances.Another significant lyric is found in Takeoff's verse, where he says, "Offset told me press the button like the game of Jeopardy." This line develops a theme of power and control. By referencing the iconic game show "Jeopardy" and the idea of pressing a button, it symbolizes the ability to make crucial and strategic decisions. It highlights the notion that success and influence come with the responsibility of making important choices that can impact one's life and those around them.Quavo adds to the thematic development with his verse, including the line, "I got the ether like Nas, I'm strapped up with ammo and bombs." This lyric introduces a theme of resilience and preparedness in the face of adversity. The reference to "ether," a diss track by Nas, signifies the ability to defend oneself and overpower adversaries. It expresses the idea that being well-equipped, mentally and physically, is essential when facing jealousy and the negative intentions of others.Offset's verse also contributes to the song's themes, particularly in the line, "I'm telling my nigga go get you because of the money, it itching their palms." This lyric reveals a theme of trust and loyalty within the context of wealth and greed. It suggests that money can bring out people's true colors and create a level of suspicion in relationships. While jealousy may lead some to turn against each other, the lyric emphasizes the importance of staying true to one another in times of temptation.Finally, the line "Don't enter Atlanta without no permission, leave 'em stanking like chitlins" from Offset's verse adds a theme of territoriality and pride. It signifies the Migos' influence and dominance in their city, Atlanta, and the consequences individuals may face if they trespass without permission. The reference to the foul odor of chitlins, a Southern dish, reinforces the idea of repelling intruders and showcasing their superiority within their home turf.Overall, the song "Jealousy" by Migos explores the overarching theme of envy while incorporating various imaginative and unexpected themes. From the exploration of hypocrisy and deception to power and control, resilience, trust, and territoriality, each standout lyric helps to develop these secondary themes. Through their engaging and thought-provoking lyrics, Migos has crafted a song that not only delves into the negative aspects of jealousy but also presents a deeper exploration of the human psyche and the consequences of envy-induced actions.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tLvCq5itoZNiuqbAx6ibZ5ufonyutcaoqmillZa7qrrGZqafZZqarq271KywZpqpYrqqs86s</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./uche-ojeh.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Uche Ojeh - Age, Net Worth, Height, Nationality, Married, Facts</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./bankroll-management-to-boost-bottom-line.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Bankroll Management: 4 Strategies to Boost Bottom Line at Online Casinos</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./20-year-sentence-2003-murder-ephrata-html.html>20-year sentence for 2003 murder in Ephrata</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./3-ways-can-remove-unwanted-blog-pages-google.html>3 Ways You Can Remove Unwanted Blog Pages From Google</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./5-rewarding-benefits-of-playing-the-violin.html>5 Rewarding Benefits of Playing the Violin</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./article-fbcffa51-ae5b-5b24-ba42-7821fc682093-html.html>Child molesters are the sweetest people | Columnists</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./woman-quells-racist-row-getting-boobs-train-html.html>Woman quells racist row by getting her boobs out on train</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaX.
