Being able to listen to each other, make sure that people are acknowledged in a relationship — and we have kids too — especially making sure that you give each other time, that she's not running to the ground. I work really hard, but at the same time too, she's at home [doing] the parenting thing.

One of the most recent updates came from Kayce Dutton actor, Luke Grimes, in July. Speaking to <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>PEOPLE</a>, he admitted: "We have not [started filming the second half of season 5] because of the writers' strike.
