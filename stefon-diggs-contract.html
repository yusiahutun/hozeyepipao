News broke that he’d been traded from Buffalo to Houston on April 3, 2024, sending shockwaves through the league—and spurring a bunch of memes in the process.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/nfl-draft-1.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/jason-kelce-retire.jpg><p>Adam Schefter tweeted, “Bills are finalizing a trade to send four-time Pro-Bowl WR Stefon Diggs to the Houston Texans for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">draft-pick compensation</a>, sources tell ESPN,” marking another move for the organization that has already spent the&nbsp;most guaranteed money&nbsp;this offseason.</p><p>Diggs was born on November 29, 1993, in Gaithersburg, Maryland. He was picked by the Minnesota Vikings in the fifth round of the 2015 NFL Draft—quickly making an impact with his route-running prowess and <a href=#>knack for making difficult catches</a>. Diggs spent the first five seasons of his NFL career with the Vikings, where he emerged as one of the league’s top receivers, before being traded to Buffalo in 2020. Now, he sets his sights to Houston. Here’s all we know about <a href=#>Stefon Diggs’ contract</a> with the Texans.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=stefon-diggs-contract>Stefon Diggs’ contract</h2><p>The actual figures concerning Stefon Diggs’ contract with the Texans have yet to be released, but as ESPN reported, Diggs’ 2024 salary cap would have been $27.854 million if he had stayed with Buffallo, but trading him means the Bills will carry a dead-money charge of $31.096 million for him this season. “If the Texans were to <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>keep Diggs on his current contract beyond this season</a>, they’d owe him $18.505 million in salary and bonuses in 2025, $19,597,941 in 2026 and an even $18 million in 2027,” reporter Dan Graziano observed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/stefon-diggs.jpg><p>“The Bills were so <a rel=nofollow href=#>desperate to get Diggs off the team</a> that it’s costing them more in cap space to NOT have him ($31.1M) than to have him ($27.9M)—a record amount of dead money for a non-QB, per Overthecap,” tweeted ESPN NFL Nation reporter Rich Cimini. However, Bills General Manager Brandon Beane told reporters that “<a href=#>The value seemed to make sense</a> and the timing made sense for them and for us,” and did not clarify whether Diggs had requested a trade.</p><p>The Bills received a 2025 second-round pick (via the Minnesota Vikings) in exchange for Diggs, a 2024 sixth-round pick (No. 189 overall) and a 2025 fifth-round pick. It comes just a day after Diggs tweeted, “You sure?” when a fan suggested he wasn’t essential to Josh Allen’s success.</p><p>When asked by NFL Network during the 2024 Pro Bowl, Diggs <a rel=nofollow href=#>was cagey about his future</a> with the Bills. “Just this season in its total, rolling with the punches, first eight games and the last eight games, or nine games, or 10 games, however you dice it, it just was a different picture. And it’s something I had to get adjusted to as a teammate, just rolling with the punches, being the best teammate you can be, best player you can be, and keep growing from it,” he said.</p><p>“I feel like I take it day by day. Obviously, there’s a lot of changes going on, a lot of things going on. I can’t really put the carriage before the horse, you know what I’m saying? But I got a great offseason in front of me to put a lot of work in and kind of build around what we got and what we’re doing. I can’t tell you what the future holds, but I’m still being me.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=how-much-was-stefon-diggs-paid-at-the-buffalo-bills>How much was Stefon Diggs paid at the Buffalo Bills?</h2><p>In 2022, Digg’s contract with the Bills was extended for an additional four years at a cost of $96 million that could reach $104&nbsp;million including $70 million that is guaranteed, making him among the highest-paid WRs in the league, fifth under Tyreek Hill, Davante Adams, Cooper Kupp, and AJ Brown.</p><p>With one year left on his original rookie contract with the Minnesota Vikings, Diggs signed a five-year, $72 million contract extension with $40 million guaranteed. The Bills inherited the final four years of that deal when they nabbed Diggs in a 2020 trade that cost them four draft picks including their first-rounder in 2020.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2iblaGyo77IrbBmppWswHB9lm1ub2hmZMC1scWopWacmZy0tHnCqKWtqpGYwXA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./lulu-lambros.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is LuLu Lambros dating?
