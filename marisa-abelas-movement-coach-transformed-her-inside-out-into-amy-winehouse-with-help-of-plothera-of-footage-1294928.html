The creators had the goal of bringing pop icon Amy Winehouse to life on screen without portraying it as a tribute. The film’s movement coach, Sara Green, recalled the “daunting” task of transforming Marisa Abela into the Valerie singer.&nbsp;</p><br><h2 id=66194361463a7><strong>Marisa Abela’s transformation into Amy Winehouse</strong></h2><p>Abela is undoubtedly a brilliant actress, but the creators' vision to bring Winehouse to life put much pressure on the movement coach, especially considering the “plethora of footage” of the late singer available. Green recalled the task as “quite daunting.”&nbsp;</p><p>Thankfully, Abela and Green met four times a week for three months before the shoot began in January 2023. These sessions were not mere rehearsals but a deep dive into the life and persona of the late singer, Amy Winehouse.</p><p>“It was really key that she could inhabit Amy from the inside out,” Green told Variety. “We’re not trying to impersonate Amy. We’re not trying to copy her. We want to understand why she moves the way she does.” <a rel=nofollow href=# class="looms--artdiv loomsart--logodiv loomsart--logodiv-v2" onclick='trigger17LoomsEntryClick("17Looms_AP_Logo","-","-","-")'><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/assets/images/17looms_pinkvilla_deshtop_article_entry_updated.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>The duo immersed themselves in the creative process and explored the singer’s life, influences, likes, dislikes, and every other tiniest detail. “It was a bit like being a detective,” the movement coach said. “You’re investigating somebody and piecing together why they did the things they did and why they moved the way they did.”</p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><p>After the three-month “thesis” on Winehouse was concluded, Abela was ready to play the pop star. “Marisa probably knew Amy better than anyone by that point,” Green said.</p><br><h2 id=66194361463b3><strong>Who was Amy Winehouse?</strong></h2><p>She was an iconic singer in the 1980s who mastered multiple genres of music, such as jazz, reggae, R&B, and soul. Winehouse’s Grammy-winning album Back to Black made her one of the most successful artists at the time.&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, her life was cut short with alcohol poisoning at the young age of 27. She was known for her voice, style and iconic looks that Abela and Green had to consider.&nbsp;</p><p>“I think the interesting thing about the ‘Back to Black’ stage of Amy is that it wasn’t something that physically crept into her, it was a very ‘smash-into’ transformation,” Green said. “It tightened up her posture, we see her losing more and more weight and we see that in her physicality, and she suddenly becomes much lighter, almost floating away from the ground.”&nbsp;</p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><p>Green talked about the late singer's physicality and iconic “beehive hair.” Being frail and having a heavy head of hair made the late singer walk a certain way.&nbsp;“It meant she really had to hold herself with a huge amount of strength. Pull all her weight into the center of her body to try and keep her balance.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>She also talked about authentically portraying the Back to Black singer’s personal struggles with addiction, which was evident in her appearance at the time.&nbsp;</p><p>Back to Black is set to hit the theaters on April 12.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sbXNpK2ipJyWe6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX528rbjYsKaonF%2BirrO10ppkmpqVoa60ecyorZ6llaPBbq%2FOmpqhZaSnrq%2B%2Fxaippp2UYrWmvoyipayhlJp6sMHTZqCnrJ9irq7FjLCgp52YpMK0sYywoK2gXZ2yrbyMqJ1mqJykwamx0ZpkqJ5dm7ywwMCgnGZpYm6Ben6X</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./the-weirdo-of-st-trinians-new-book-claims-alastair-sim-scholarly-young-girls-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The Weirdo Of St Trinian's: New book claims Alastair Sim had more than a scholarly interest in young</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./m5-accident-pedestrian-hit-by-hours-delays.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>M5 accident: Pedestrian hit by a lorry &amp;amp; airlifted to hospital as Taunton accident causes hours of d</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./20-year-sentence-2003-murder-ephrata-html.html>20-year sentence for 2003 murder in Ephrata</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./3-ways-can-remove-unwanted-blog-pages-google.html>3 Ways You Can Remove Unwanted Blog Pages From Google</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./5-rewarding-benefits-of-playing-the-violin.html>5 Rewarding Benefits of Playing the Violin</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./article-fbcffa51-ae5b-5b24-ba42-7821fc682093-html.html>Child molesters are the sweetest people | Columnists</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./woman-quells-racist-row-getting-boobs-train-html.html>Woman quells racist row by getting her boobs out on train</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaX.
