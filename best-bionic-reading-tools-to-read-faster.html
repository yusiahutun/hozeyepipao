This article is for you if you have found yourself in any of these situations. We will review the best tools to help you cover those pages in record time without missing out on any information.</p><h2 id=what-is-bionic-reading-and-why-is-it-important>What Is Bionic Reading, and Why Is It Important?</h2><p>Bionic reading is a speed reading technique that highlights different parts of a word as your primary focus while reading. This way, your brain does not focus on reading the entire word as in regular text. Instead, it highlights the first letters in each word, so your eyes focus on those letters, and your brain does the comprehension.</p><p>Unlike other speed reading methods that require training or time investment, bionic reading is designed to be as natural as regular reading. Currently, bionic reading lacks sufficient evidence to prove that it works. However, many users have stated that it has helped them absorb more information faster. On the contrary, some users have found no difference in reading speed while using this method.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-4-best-bionic-reading-tools-that-help-you-read-faster>The 4 Best Bionic Reading Tools That Help You Read Faster</h2><p>Often called bionic reading converters, these bionic reading tools exist as web browser extensions or mobile apps on Android and iOS. The Bionic Reading app remains one of the top tools as it is available in all three formats—however, there are other great alternatives that we will be looking at.</p><p>Since we have already discussed <a href=#>bionic reading and why you should use it</a>, let us examine the best bionic reading tools to help you read faster.</p><h3 id=bionic-reading>1.

It also has a free web browser extension. This tool has a concise and direct interface, alongside various methods of providing the text to speed read.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For one, you can type your text directly into the provided space. Doing this will convert your text from the regular to the enhanced format for your reading. Alternatively, you can upload any file of your choice. Bionic Reading supports a variety of file formats, including documents and EPUB. Finally, you can enter a web address while the app converts it into the bionic format.</p><p>There are different settings on the bionic app to customize your reading experience. It allows you to choose which letters and syllables to focus on while reading. Moreover, Bionic Reading lets you select which background color to read on.</p><p>One of the many advantages of this tool is that you can download the converted material to your device in PDF or EPUB format. You can also send it to your Amazon Kindle. That way, you always have an enhanced text copy anytime, any day. Another stand-out feature of Bionic Reading is that it does not alter the layout of the text. The paragraphs, font size, and spacing all stay the same.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Download: </strong>Bionic Reading for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">Android</a> | <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">iOS</a> | <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Website</a> (Free)</p><h3 id=bionify>2.

You must <a href=#>install and manage the extension from the Chrome Web Store</a> to use Bionify. After downloading, you must pin it to the extension bar. Bionify only works on your current page, and you can always turn it off anytime you want.</p><p>Like Bionic Reading, Bionify highlights the first letters or syllables of every word, depending on the length of the word. Doing this helps you focus on the bolded parts of the word while your brain fills in the gaps as you read. Currently, this software does not work on downloaded documents like PDFs. It is strictly for web pages and does not alter the page's layout or any other features on the page.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Website:</strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bionify</a> (Free)</p><h3 id=bioread>3.
