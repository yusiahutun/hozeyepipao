According to <a href=#>Realtor.com</a>, Brown purchased the house in 2018 for $829,000 when it was newly built.</p><p>The listing shows an elegant 4-bedroom, 3.5-bathroom, 4,493-square-foot house that sits on 1.15 acres of prime land in the exclusive Southern Preserve neighborhood in Franklin, a community that is home to a number of country stars and other country music movers and shakers.</p><p>The listing touts "location and luxury" as two of the main selling points, pointing out the "rare opportunity" to live in Southern Preserve, which is just 3 miles from I-840 and offers easy access to great shopping and dining at Cool Springs, as well as a relatively short commute to Nashville.</p><p>The main floor of the house features a master suite with an attached "flex room" that could easily be a study, as well as a master bathroom with double vanities. There's also a chef's kitchen with an island that opens onto a family room with a gorgeous fireplace.</p><p>The upstairs offers three bedrooms, all with walk-in closets, as well as a separate playroom and an oversized bonus room. The well-appointed home features shiplap and high-beamed ceilings throughout, while the exterior features a wrap-around porch with an outdoor fireplace. The property "backs to a peaceful horse farm," according to the listing.</p><p>Brown's house made headlines in 2019, when <a href=#>Jason Aldean</a> and his wife and children <a href=#>stayed there</a> while they were building their dream home. He has since moved into a staggeringly luxurious home with his family, while Brown and Katelyn have purchased 30 acres in a more rural location and recently moved into a new home there. That house also made headlines when Brown revealed that he had <a href=#>gotten lost on his property</a> on the day they moved in and had to rescued by the police.</p><p>Scroll through the pictures below to see inside Kane Brown's luxurious house.</p><p><strong>See Inside Kane Brown's Luxurious Rural Retreat:</strong></p><p><strong>See Pictures of Jason Aldean's Amazing New Mansion:&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>See Pictures of Jason Aldean's Previous Fairytale Mansion:</strong></p><p><strong>See Inside Jason Aldean's Other Amazing Rural Retreat:</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmpJmemnqjvs6wpWarlaG5qrrGZp%2BoraOaerG1wq2sq52jZA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./546398-tenant-redecorates-room-dark-colours-paints-wc-sink-black-landlady-cries.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Tenant Redecorates Room with Dark Colours, Paints WC and Sink Black, his Landlady Cries</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jennifer-lopez-see-through-top-short-shorts-ben-affleck-features-milestone.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jennifer Lopez poses in see-through top and short-shorts - and Ben Affleck features too</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./20-year-sentence-2003-murder-ephrata-html.html>20-year sentence for 2003 murder in Ephrata</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./3-ways-can-remove-unwanted-blog-pages-google.html>3 Ways You Can Remove Unwanted Blog Pages From Google</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./5-rewarding-benefits-of-playing-the-violin.html>5 Rewarding Benefits of Playing the Violin</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./article-fbcffa51-ae5b-5b24-ba42-7821fc682093-html.html>Child molesters are the sweetest people | Columnists</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./woman-quells-racist-row-getting-boobs-train-html.html>Woman quells racist row by getting her boobs out on train</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaX.
