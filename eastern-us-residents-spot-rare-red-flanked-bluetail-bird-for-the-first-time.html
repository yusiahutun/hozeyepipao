He spotted the gray bird outside his home with its blue tail and yellow sides.</p><p>At 69, Riker spends considerable time bird-watching the feeders outside his Whiting, New Jersey home. Despite his expertise, he couldn’t identify a rare bird that landed in his yard on December 5, even after using a popular birding app.</p><p>“I posted on Facebook (to a local bird-watching community) and asked for help,” Riker recalled.</p><p>However, a group member identified the bird as a red-flanked bluetail. According to the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, these birds typically inhabit northern Europe and Asia.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Alleged Eagle Killing Spree Discovered: Two Men Indicted for Black Market Sales</a></strong></p><p>A few individuals in the U.S. have confirmed sightings of the bird. According to Jenna Curtis, a bird expert for Cornell’s eBird.org website, all of these reports were in the country’s western half.</p><p>Since the red-flanked bluetail’s appearance outside Riker’s house, bird lovers all over have flocked to his community to catch a glimpse.</p><p>“These birders are all over the neighborhood,” he said. “The neighbors seem to love it. We’re all retired, and we’re really enjoying it. This is good excitement.”</p><p><a href=#><strong>POLL — Is Climate Change a Major Threat That Requires Immediate Policy Action?</strong></a></p><p>Curtis confirmed Riker’s photograph is “the first-ever confirmed red-flanked bluetail in the eastern U.S.” The bird sighting as far east as New Jersey is an “unprecedented occurrence,” according to Curtis.</p><p>“The next nearest report was a bird in Laramie, Wyoming, in November 2019,” Curtis said. Additionally, Red-flanked bluetails are known for their colorful plumage.</p><p>Males may have shimmering blue feathers, orange sides, and a small white “eyebrow.” Females and juveniles, as per eBird.org, typically have tan bodies with subdued blue coloring.</p><p>The breeding range of the East Asian songbird has steadily expanded over the past century. However, its presence in the eastern U.S. has puzzled Cornell experts.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Scientists Believe Saccorhytus, A Strange-Looking Extinct Creature is Humans’s Earliest Ancestor&nbsp;</a></strong></p><p>More than 130 other sightings from Ocean County have been submitted to eBird.org since Riker spotted the bird in his backyard, according to Curtis.</p><p>“They currently breed as far west as Finland and winter in China and Japan,” Curtis said.</p><p>Additionally, scientists believe a small number of the birds may have migrated to the western U.S. after crossing the Bering Strait into Alaska.&nbsp;</p><p>“I don’t know whether the bird in New Jersey … just kept traveling east (from the West Coast), or whether it traveled westward from Europe, perhaps carried by strong winds or a major storm,” Curtis said. “I think it is unlikely that this bird arrived via shipping container.”</p><p>The American Birding Association suggests it may be impossible to determine the bird’s direction in Riker’s yard. The species is a rare but increasing vagrant to western Europe, with several records in Iceland, including two earlier this fall.</p><p><strong>You Might Also Like:</strong></p><p><a href=#>California Gov.
