As a young boy, Ferrari fell in love with race car driving after watching a motor car race in Bologna with his father, according to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/business-leaders/a46119935/enzo-ferrari-sons-piero-alfredo data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Biography class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Biography</a>. However, Ferrari would face much tragedy as a young man after both his father and his brother died in 1916 from the flu. Ferrari, too, would develop a serious case of the flu, which led to him being honourably discharged from the Italian Army in 1917, Biography noted.</p><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for Ferrari – official trailer (Sky Studios)" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/images/adam-driver-ferrari-trailer-652fdbfeb3075.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Prior to developing his namesake brand, Ferrari started his career as a race car driver in 1919, joining the Alfa Romeo team the following year, with whom he won multiple Grand Prix races, via Biography. By 1929, Ferrari had founded his own racing team, which he named Scuderia Ferrari, says <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Enzo-Ferrari data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Brittanica class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Brittanica</a>.

The company supplied vehicles to the the Italian military during World War II, alongside building and repairing cars. After a few false starts, Ferrari’s cars soon found success on the race track, particularly following the launch of Formula 1, says Brittanica.</p><img alt=ferrari title="Ferrari " width=3000 height=2000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/fl-03-ferrari-659e5f79996be.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Neon/STX International</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The movie Ferrari is set in 1957, which was a particularly difficult year in Enzo’s life. Although his drivers had found success on the race track in Ferrari vehicles, the team also faced multiple tragedies. In 1955, driver Alberto Ascari was killed while driving a Ferrari sports car, and three more drivers—Eugenio Castellotti, Luigi Musso, and Peter Collins—all died while using Ferrari Formula 1 cars between 1957 and 1958, reports Brittanica.</p><h2 data-node-id=14 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">The Mille Miglia tragedy changed everything</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">While racing in the Mille Miglia in 1957, Ferrari driver Alfonso de Portago was involved in a fatal accident after a tire blew out, sending the car flying into the air where it hit a telephone pole, via <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://vault.si.com/vault/1957/05/20/horror-in-italy data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Vault class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Vault</a>. In a truly devastating turn of events, the car landed in a crowd of spectators who had gathered to watch the race, killing at least nine people, alongside Portago and his passenger, Edmund Nelson, via Vault and Brittanica.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As a result of the horrific accident, racing on public roads was outlawed by the Italian government, and Ferrari himself was charged with manslaughter. However, he was later acquitted, reports Brittanica.</p><img alt=ferrari title="ferrari " width=3288 height=2274 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/fl-05-ferrari-659d63db897a6.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Eros Hoagland</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Another of Ferrari’s drivers, 50-year-old Piero Taruffi (played by Patrick Dempsey), won the race, forgoing retirement to drive for Enzo, via Vault. In fact, Ferraris accounted for eight of the first ten cars to pass the finish line, proving that the company was at the top of its game in many ways, Vault reported. However, the loss of life that occurred during Portago’s crash undeniably impacted Enzo and everyone at the Ferrari company.</p><h2 data-node-id=19 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">Ferrari had a complicated personal life</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Aside from Enzo Ferrari’s career, Michael Mann’s biopic also focuses on the Ferrari founder’s personal life. As well as exploring Enzo’s flailing marriage to wife Laura Ferrari, played by Penélope Cruz, the film also details his romantic relationship with Lina Lardi, played by Shailene Woodley, says <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/movies-tv/a44975974/ferrari-movie-true-story data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Biography class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Biography</a>.</p><img alt=ferrari title="Ferrari " width=3000 height=2000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/ferrari-01914-photo-credit-lorenzo-sisti-659e5efb5f5aa.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Neon/STX International</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Enzo married Laura Garello in 1923, and the couple’s son, Alfredo “Dino” Ferrari, arrived in 1932, via Brittanica. Dino shared his father’s interest in cars, but he was diagnosed with muscular dystrophy, which led to his untimely death at the age of 24, per Brittanica. Having been the assumed heir to Ferrari’s empire, Dino’s death was a crushing moment in Enzo’s life. According to Biography, the businessman became somewhat of a recluse following his son’s death.</p><img alt=ferrari title="Ferrari " width=6240 height=4160 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/ferrari-eh-06325-photo-credit-eros-hoagland-659d63dc364b6.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Neon/STX International</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As noted by Biography, Enzo and Laura’s relationship only worsened following Dino’s death, while Enzo’s affairs also took a toll on the marriage.
