Urban Outfitters Openly Uses Lead in Their Products" href=#><strong><a href=# id=auto-tag_urban-outfitters data-tag=urban-outfitters>Urban Outfitters</a> </strong>openly lists highly toxic metal lead</a> in some of their accessories and other products. As horrifying as that may sound, apparently it’s more commonplace than we’d all like to think.</p><p><strong>Caroline Cox,&nbsp;</strong>a head researcher at the&nbsp;<strong>Center for Environmental Health (CEH), </strong>keyed us into the <a href=# rel=nofollow>multi-year research</a> she and her team have been doing into the amounts of lead used in fashion products. While you would think that the production teams at most companies are aware that lead is toxic and shouldn’t be used, over the past few years it’s still been a major problem.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Reiss-Spring-Dresses-2024.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/reiss-outlet-deals_ed00da.png><p>“We started working on this in 2008, and at that point, what we discovered through our testing was that lead-containing pigments were really common in fashion accessories made of artificial leather, primarily the brightly colored items,” Cox tells StyleCaster. “Red, orange, yellow, green, those kinds of colors. We identified more than 200 companies that were selling these kinds of products.”</p><p>After they made this startling discovery, Cox tells us, the CEH brought litigation against 200 companies, requiring them to sign legally binding agreements that they would “stop using lead-containing pigments, and reduce the amount of lead in the products to trace amounts, or no more than 300 parts per million.” After following up with them post-litigation, the vast majority of the companies have complied, Cox says, except for three: <strong><a href=# id=auto-tag_forever-21 data-tag=forever-21>Forever 21</a>, <a href=# id=auto-tag_charlotte-russe data-tag=charlotte-russe>Charlotte Russe</a>, </strong>and <strong>We</strong><strong>t Seal.</strong></p><p>“Charlotte Russe has met with us since then, and they are really trying to take steps to remedy the problem,” Cox says. “I’m not sure why they weren’t able to remedy it sooner, but they seem to be really headed in the right direction. Based on what our most recent testing at Forever 21 and Wet Seal, they haven’t actually spoken with us about it, but I think they’re doing a better job than they were before.</p><p>“We think things are headed in the right direction. I would still encourage people who are shopping at those stores to stay away from brightly colored artificial leather items, just to be sure.”</p><a id=QeDlb97IQV1n7rgwS1m14w class=gie-single href=#>Embed from Getty Images</a><p><strong>How Urban Outfitters Gets Away With It</strong></p><p>We asked Caroline to clarify why Urban wasn’t on her list of companies to watch out for when it comes to the use of lead. She responded, via e-mail: “More than 95% of the time we have been successful in getting fashion accessory companies to remove lead from their products. Occasionally a company will choose to put up warning signs instead of removing the lead. Urban Outfitters is one of those companies.”</p><p><strong>How to Avoid Lead<br></strong></p><p>Cox says that because there aren’t any official methods by which the FDA and the CEH measure the amount of lead used in garment manufacturing, it’s really tough to advise people on how to avoid it. As she mentioned, lead pigments are most often used in brightly colored objects, so it’s wise to avoid any bags, jewelry, or other accessories that sport those vivid deep dyes in artificial leathers and other man-made fabrics.</p><p>“As far as avoiding toxic chemicals in general, I personally as much as possible try to find clothing and stuff made of natural materials like cotton, wool, and leather,” Cox recommends. “I think there’s fewer problems with natural materials. And if you can find what you’re looking for in organic cotton, that helps even more.”</p><p>The short answer to a long-standing problem: it’s wise to analyze the content of every piece at Urban Outfitters, and to avoid buying those that list lead as an ingredient. For other fast-fashion retailers, avoid bright colors in artificial materials.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57xZqqoaGfo3ynrdKhoKimX2eAdYWTcWalnZGZeqq6jJyjqKyYnruoew%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./gwyneth-s-goop-doctors-hit-haters-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Gwyneth's Goop doctors hit back at their haters</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./azealia-banks-instagram-twitter-naked-16801256.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Azealia Banks stuns with bizarre topless Twitter clip exposing EVERYTHING</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./20-year-sentence-2003-murder-ephrata-html.html>20-year sentence for 2003 murder in Ephrata</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./3-ways-can-remove-unwanted-blog-pages-google.html>3 Ways You Can Remove Unwanted Blog Pages From Google</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./5-rewarding-benefits-of-playing-the-violin.html>5 Rewarding Benefits of Playing the Violin</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./article-fbcffa51-ae5b-5b24-ba42-7821fc682093-html.html>Child molesters are the sweetest people | Columnists</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./woman-quells-racist-row-getting-boobs-train-html.html>Woman quells racist row by getting her boobs out on train</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaX.
