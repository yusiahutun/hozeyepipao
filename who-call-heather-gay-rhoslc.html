We built the show with her. But I don’t think we missed her in the sense of toxicity,” she said. Whitney also teased new Housewife Monica and her dynamic with the cast. “She brought it for sure. And I think a lot of people are nervous about not having Jen,” she said. “But we brought it. It’s still everything.” Whitney went on to reveal that Monica once worked for Jen. “So I had heard about her because she worked for Jen and her name is brought up a lot on the streets,” Whitney said.</p><p>But back to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">who called Heather in The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City Season 4</a>? Read on for what we know about the mysterious RHOSLC caller.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=who-called-heather-gay-in-the-real-housewives-of-salt-lake-city-season-4-premiere>Who called Heather Gay in The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City Season 4 premiere?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Heather-Gay-The-Real-Housewives-of-Salt-Lake-City.jpg><p>Who called Heather Gay in The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City Season 4 finale? In the cold opening of The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City Season 4, Episode 1, Heather receives a mysterious phone call while in Bermuda on May 10, 2023. “Hey, what did you find out?” Heather tells the caller. “Are you kidding me right now? Shut the fuck up.” Heather continues as her voice starts to break, “I’m trembling. I cannot believe it’s her. How could she do this to us? I’m freaking the fuck out. I’m freaking the fuck out”</p><p>Only her audio could be heard as the camera shows producers scrambling to film her. The camera shows a producer knocking on Heather’s door before another tells the camera person to “just go in.” The camera person then finds Heather on the phone of the balcony of her room as Heather forces the camera person toward the exit. “You guys, seriously, no. Seriously, no. You guys, for real,” Heather says as the camera person leaves her room. The cold opening ends with Heather’s voice playing over footage of snowy mountain tops. “How did we all fall for it?” Heather says. “I don’t know who to trust anymore.”</p><p>Who called Heather in The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City Season 4 finale? The most popular theory is that the call is from someone who informed Heather that Monica, a new cast member on The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City, intended to sue Heather’s business Beauty Lab + Laser. The Sun reported in November 2023 that Beauty Lab + Laser filed a lawsuit against Monica in August 2023 for breach of contract and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, claiming that Monica signed a contract with them on December 10, 2019, to pay $2,449 for cosmetic injection services.</p><p>The documents obtained by The Sun state that Monica only paid $449 of the initial payment, which included a $49 set-up fee and a $400 down payment. She was supposed to make $200 monthly payments for the next 10 months however never did, the documents claim. Beauty Lab + Laser argue that it “suffered and continues to suffer significant losses and damages” as a result of Monica not paying the full amount. The business requested the court to determine at trial how much—”not less than $2,000″—Monica should hand over, as well as “reasonable attorney’s fees, and other remedies provided by statute or contract.”</p><p>In September 2023, Monica filed a counterclaim against Beauty Lab + Laser. The counterclaim was amended two months later and refiled on November 7, 2023. Monica sued Beauty Lab + Laser for breach of independent duty of care, breach of contract, and breach of good faith and fair dealing. In the documents obtained by The Sun, Monica confirmed that she only paid Beauty Lab + Laser $449 for her total payment because she believed she “received defectively, negligently given injections, which did not have the intended, promised result.” As a result of the injections, which she described as “botched,” Monica claimed she had to go to another “competent party to fix the damage” to her nose and lips. She continued in the lawsuit, “The parties reached an oral accord and satisfaction wherein Monica paid for another, competent party to fix the damage to Monica’s nose and lips caused by the incompetent, negligent actions of Beauty Lab’s staff, and Beauty Lab was entitled to no further payment.”</p><p>Monica argued that Beauty Lab + Laser “promised” they would not seek further payment. As for her complaints, Monica claimed that she was given nose injections “in a negligent, medically deficient manner” that “diminished” the appearance of Monica’s nose and “the appearance of Monica’s lips was not improved.”</p><p>In an Instagram post in Noveber 2023, Heather slammed Monica for her lawsuit against her. “Beauty Lab + Laser is a phenomenal business, in the top 1% of providers, with over 3,000 positive reviews,” she captioned a video ad for Beauty Lab + Laser. “Our injectors are nationally ranked and leaders within the industry and our legion of loyal customers speaks for itself. This lawsuit in the press has no merit and is unfortunately a pattern of behavior from a desperate woman who when unable to pay her bills lashes out to avoid accountability. @beauty.lab.laser #teambll #thelablovesyou.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>RHOSLC cast member Meredith Marks also reacted to the lawsuit between Heather and Monica in an interview with <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/meredith-marks-reacts-to-monica-garcia-and-heather-gay-lawsuit/>Us Weekly </a>at the time. “There’s some stuff that you will learn that I knew about prior to hearing [about the lawsuits] which made it a little less shocking,” she said. “But it’s still surprising.”</p><p>Prior to Heather and Monica’s lawsuit, the most popular theory was that Heather’s call in the RHOSLC Season 4 finale was about Jen Shah, who starred on The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City from Seasons 1 to 3. Jen left The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City following Season 3 after she pled guilty to fraud charges and was sentenced to six and a half years in prison. Jen is currently incarcerated at Federal Prison Camp Bryan in Bryan, Texas, where Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes is also serving an 11-year sentence.</p><p>During an episode on the podcast “<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Two Ts in a Pod</a>” in August 2023, Whitney Rose, another Real Housewives of Salt Lake City cast member, claimed that the only cast member she believed to be in touch with Jen was Heather, though she couldn’t confirm if the two had spoken since Jen went to prison. Some fans believe that it’s unlikely that Heather’s call came from Jen given that the call seemed to start right away after Heather picked up her phone. According the Federal Bureau of Prisons website, for which Federal Prison Camp Bryan is listed under, Jen most likely paid for the call so there may not have been a notice after Heather picked up the phone that the call was from Jen. “Ordinarily, the inmate pays for the calls; but in some cases the receiving party pays,” the site read.</p><p>On May 17, 2023, seven days after Heather’s call, Whitney shared a cryptic <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Instagram</a> post about “personal growth” and “self love.” “The only thing that I am currently turning up for is my spirituality, personal growth and self love. Who is with me? . . #spirituality #healingjourney #intentionaljewelry #selflove #personalgrowth #spiritualawakening #rhoslc,” captioned the post.</p><p>Meredith Marks, another Real Housewives of Salt Lake City cast member, also shared an <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Instagram</a> post from Bermuda on May 21, 2023, hinting at the “shade” she experienced during the season. “Unbothered by the shade and loving the heat,” she captioned the post. Angie Katsanevas, who also stars on The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City, shared an <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Instagram</a> post on May 19, 2023, of her filming the finale. “It’s a Wrap,” she captioned the post.</p><p>The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City is available to stream on Peacock.
