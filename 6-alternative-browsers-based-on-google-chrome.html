It's&nbsp;installed by default with Comodo Internet Security.</p><p>You'd think a "secure" web browser made by a security software company would be...well, secure, but it's had some big problems. Google's Tavis Ormandy found that the browser <a href=#>shipped with a serious problem</a> that destroyed the security of <a href=#>HTTPS encryption</a>. As he put it: "Chromodo is described as 'highest levels of speed, security and privacy', but actually disables all web security."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Comodo responded by issuing a fix that didn't actually fix the problem. Comodo did fix it eventually, but that doesn't change the fact that such a glaring security problem shipped with the browser. Companies like Google, Mozilla, Microsoft, and Apple have never made such a big mistake in their products. Comodo doesn't sound like a company we'd want to get our web browser from.</p><h2 id=srware-iron-s-privacy-claims-are-exaggerated-and-it-s-slow-to-update>SRWare Iron's Privacy Claims Are Exaggerated, and It's Slow to Update</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/img_58cc6acbae0c9.png><p>SRWare Iron&nbsp;promises to remove various privacy-infringing options from Google Chrome.&nbsp;But it isn't as good as it sounds.</p><p>Right off the bat, there's something we don't like: On March 17, 2017, the latest version of SRWare Iron was version 56.0.2950.1. The latest version of Chrome was version&nbsp;57.0.2987.110, released on March 16. That means SRWare Iron was missing more than 36 security fixes&nbsp;that Chrome had for over a week.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>That's because SRWare Iron's developers have to do some work to release those security fixes whenever Google releases a new version of Chrome.&nbsp;It's not instant, and these third-party projects may take a long time to issue updates if their developers are busy.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How to Optimize Google Chrome for Maximum Privacy</a></span></p><p>But here's the real kicker:&nbsp;you aren't really getting any extra privacy out of SRWare Iron. Most of what SRWare Iron does is possible through Chrome's regular privacy settings. And if you enable those tweaks in Chrome, you'll get the latest security updates without waiting for and trusting another company.</p><h2 id=chromium-isn-t-for-users-except-on-linux>Chromium Isn't For Users (Except on Linux)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/img_58cc6fcc05157.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Google doesn't want you using the open-source Chromium browser. That's why <a href=#>the Chromium project</a> only offers "raw builds" of Chromium code that "may be tremendously buggy" for Windows. They also don't include an auto-update feature, so you have to manually download new versions with security and bug fixes. These Chromium builds are really just development tools for checking whether issues are fixed in the latest Chromium code. Stay away.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What’s the Difference Between Chromium and Chrome?</a></span></p><p><a href=#>Chromium's&nbsp;main difference is that it's entirely&nbsp;open-source</a>, while Google Chrome includes a few closed-source pieces (like Flash). That's why Chromium is often made available via <a href=#>the package repositories</a> on Linux distributions. A Chromium browser obtained from your Linux package repositories&nbsp;should be safe and receive regular security updates from your Linux distribution.

Some browsers are solid alternatives to Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and Internet Explorer.</p><p><a href=#>Opera</a>, for example, has been around in one form or another for a long time, with the first version of Opera being released back in 1995. In 2013, the company abandoned its old, homegrown browser engine, Presto, and Opera is now based&nbsp;on Chromium.</p><p>But Opera isn't just a Chrome clone---it's a unique browser with its own unique features, like a built-in VPN that can secure your web browsing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/img_58cc79cf6b094.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Best Features of Vivaldi, a New Customizable Web Browser for Power Users</a></span></p><p><a href=#>Vivaldi</a>&nbsp;is also based on Chromium, and was created by former Opera developers who disagree with Opera's new direction. Released in 2016, Vivaldi attempts to restore <a href=#>various "power user" features</a> the Opera project has removed. For example, Vivaldi allows you to make your tabs appear as vertical thumbnails, something that just isn't possible in Chrome. The developers are working on adding a built-in email client, a feature no longer included on the latest versions of Opera.</p><p>Both Opera and Vivaldi support Chrome extensions, as they're based on the same underlying technology. If you're looking for a new browser that still uses Chrome's speedy rendering engine and supports the same browser extensions you use in Chrome, these browsers are interesting options you may want to try.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Is a "Portable" App, and Why Does It Matter?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Lastly, you may also consider a portable version of Chrome or Chromium. The <a href=#>Chromium Portable</a> project, for example, is a customized build of Chromium designed to run as a "<a href=#>portable application</a>".

You probably aren't looking for that.

But we're skeptical of them, and you should be too.</p><p>Here's the issue:&nbsp;Browsers are very important programs. You spend almost all of your internet-connected time in a browser, so it needs&nbsp;to be secure. Part of that means getting&nbsp;security updates very quickly when they're released, and smaller Chromium-based browsers don't always do that. Furthermore, you're trusting a small company or group of developers to make changes to your browser, which can introduce problems---intentional or not.</p><p>Comodo's security problems and SRWare's update delays are a few examples of the problems that can occur, even when a browser developer is acting in good faith. And if a browser developer isn't acting in good faith, you're in an even worse position: they could snoop on your web browsing&nbsp;and abuse its access to your computer.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even if you don't trust Google, Google is a large company with a lot of eyes on it. Google won't steal your credit card number. If Google does something bad or makes a big mistake in Chrome, everyone will hear about it. The same isn't true for these Chromium alternatives.</p><p>Many of the features promised in various third-party browsers can be achieved simply by tweaking Chrome's settings or installing extensions from the <a href=#>Chrome Web Store</a>. You're better off using&nbsp;Google Chrome and installing a few browser extensions than switching to a Chrome-based alternative.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvWraagnZWge6S7zGhoaXBjbYFwgoyao62doqOutbXVnmSbqp%2BswKa%2B0maZmquVmXqwuoygpqifnJp6pLTRqKSeZw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./inside-emma-roberts-and-julia-roberts-top-three-movies.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Detailing Emma Roberts and Julia Robert's Top Three Movies</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./lulu-lambros.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is LuLu Lambros dating?
