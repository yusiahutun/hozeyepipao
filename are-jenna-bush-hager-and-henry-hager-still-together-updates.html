The<a href=#> Today</a> host and the businessman’s relationship began during her father <a href=#><strong>George W. Bush</strong></a>’s presidency.

Jenna recalled their chaotic first date.</p><p>“My worst first date involved the Secret Service, let’s just leave it at that,” the Love Comes First author said during a February 2021 <a href=#>Today</a> episode. “It was with Henry, and his car ran out of gas and went backward and hit the Secret Service.”</p><p>Henry asked Jenna’s father for her hand in marriage during ​the 4th of July weekend in 2007. After receiving his blessing, the businessman proposed to his partner during a camping trip later that year.</p><h2><strong>When Did Jenna Bush Hager and Henry Hager Get Married?</strong></h2><p>On May 10, 2008, the news personality and the business executive got married at the Bush family’s Prairie Chapel Ranch in Crawford Texas.
