Waldrup then attended Jones County Junior College and transferred&nbsp;to Mississippi State University to major in forestry. During the summers, he fought brush fires in&nbsp;California and worked on the pipeline throughout the United States to earn his college funds. This&nbsp;turned his attention away from forestry and toward education. Waldrup received his bachelor’s and&nbsp;master’s degrees in education from Delta State University and furthered his professional development&nbsp;at the University of Southern Mississippi. During this time in his life, he met a Mississippi Delta girl,&nbsp;Patricia Jones, who also turned into his wife of 54 years. Waldrup was an active member at First Baptist</span><span>Church of Ellisville for 47 years and, more recently, First Baptist Church of Laurel for the remainder of his&nbsp;life.</span></p><p><span>During the early years of his career, Waldrup taught at Bay St. Louis and Ruleville High School,&nbsp;but landed in his dream location at Jones County Junior College. He spent 34 years at Jones, climbing the&nbsp;ladder from dean of men to vice president of Student Affairs, where he dedicated his time and energy to&nbsp;shaping the lives of countless students. Connecting with thousands of students, professional friends and&nbsp;lifelong friends, Waldrup brought recruiting at Jones to a new level with higher enrollment numbers&nbsp;tailored to fostering personal growth and development. Waldrup understood that education was not&nbsp;confined to the classroom; it extended to the very essence of one’s being.</span></p><p><span>After retiring from Jones, Waldrup was elected mayor of Ellisville, becoming a public servant to&nbsp;his community. In this capacity, he continuously embodied unwavering dedication to the people of&nbsp;Ellisville. Serving 16 years as mayor allowed him to become president of the Mississippi Municipal&nbsp;League, thus improving his relationships and network and improving infrastructure and the quality of life</span><span>for residents. In 2017, Waldrup finally retired after 50 years of public service, only to be bombarded by&nbsp;serious health issues until he succumbed to his complications.</span></p><p><span>Waldrup’s influence extended beyond his professional accomplishments. He was a loving&nbsp;husband, a devoted father and a doting grandfather. His family was his pride and joy, and he cherished&nbsp;every moment spent with them. Waldrup’s wisdom, guidance and unconditional love will continue to&nbsp;resonate through the generations, leaving an indelible mark on his family’s lives.</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Waldrup was preceded in death by his parents Frank Green and Ruby Irene Waldrup; and his&nbsp;sisters Patricia McAlpin and Fern Barefoot.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Tim is survived by his wife Patricia; his daughter Missie Lee&nbsp;Meeks (Bobby); his grandsons Kaleb Robert Meeks and Dylan Thomas Meeks (Madeline); his sister-in-law Donna Jones; his nephews Donald Ray Barefoot, Kyle Barefoot, Terry Barefoot and John Gentry;&nbsp;his nieces Sherry Barefoot Carr and Connie Crosby Rambin.</span></p><p><span>Visitation will be at First Baptist Church of Laurel on Saturday, Feb. 3, from 12:30-2:30 p.m. The service will take place in the sanctuary at 2:30 p.m. A private family burial service will&nbsp;follow.</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Pallbearers will be grandsons Kaleb Robert Meeks and Dylan Thomas Meeks, lifelong friend Robert&nbsp;Landrum, professional/close friend Dr. Ronald Whitehead, and nephews Donald Ray Barefoot</span><span>and John Gentry.</span></p><p><span>The Waldrup family asks that in lieu of flowers, donations be made to the Tim Waldrup&nbsp;Leadership Scholarship at Jones College or the building fund at First Baptist Church of Laurel or First&nbsp;Baptist Church of Ellisville.</span></p><p><span>Ellisville Funeral Home is in charge of arrangements.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHAnZyrZZOWua16wqikaKeSnsG2rdGinKxnpJ28rq3SZqSam5tixKK4w6usqWeRp8Gqr8uelmpvZJawdXyRZppqa2VifnKxxGaZa5yWYoJ0rZFuaWttZGuxo3rHraSl</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./wimbledon-chinas-wu-yibing-has-halt-interview-he-explains-medical-mystery-caused-collapse-against.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Wimbledon tennis 2023: Chinas Wu Yibing has to halt interview as he explains medical mystery that</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./gabriel-fluffy-iglesias-becomes-the-first-comedian-to-sell-out-a-show-at-dodger-stadium-in-los-angeles.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Gabriel Fluffy Iglesias Becomes The First Comedian To Sell Out A Show At Dodger Stadium In Los</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./20-year-sentence-2003-murder-ephrata-html.html>20-year sentence for 2003 murder in Ephrata</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./3-ways-can-remove-unwanted-blog-pages-google.html>3 Ways You Can Remove Unwanted Blog Pages From Google</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./5-rewarding-benefits-of-playing-the-violin.html>5 Rewarding Benefits of Playing the Violin</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./article-fbcffa51-ae5b-5b24-ba42-7821fc682093-html.html>Child molesters are the sweetest people | Columnists</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./woman-quells-racist-row-getting-boobs-train-html.html>Woman quells racist row by getting her boobs out on train</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaX.
