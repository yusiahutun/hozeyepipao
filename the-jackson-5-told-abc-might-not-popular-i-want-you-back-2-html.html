In February 1970, we followed up with ‘ABC’ which also went No. 1, selling 2 million copies in three weeks.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><h2>The Jackson 5 were told ‘ABC’ might not perform as well as ‘I Want You Back’ because ‘I Want You Back’ was the band’s 1st single</h2><p id=par-4_88>During an interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Guardian</a>, Tito said he was nervous when The Jackson 5 released “ABC.” “‘ABC’ was more nail-biting [than ‘I Want You Back’],” he said. “We’d been told the second hit is harder than the first, so to watch that one go up the charts was even more amazing. Then it happened with ‘The Love You Save,’ too. We didn’t think we’d do it a fourth time with ‘I’ll Be There.'” Marlon Jackson said the members of The Jackson 5 were shocked by their success.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><h2 id=h-the-way-the-world-reacted-to-abc>The way the world reacted to ‘ABC’</h2><p id=par-5_48>“ABC” became a massive international hit.
