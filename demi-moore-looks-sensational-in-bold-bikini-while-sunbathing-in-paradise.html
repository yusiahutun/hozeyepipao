Her bold swimsuit is teased in the photo as she smiles from ear to ear with her pup laying on her chest.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-demi-moore-greets-fans-with-swimsuit-photo>Demi Moore greets fans with swimsuit photo</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/08/GettyImages-1183645571-1024x683.jpg><p>The Ghost actor took to <a href=#>Instagram</a> to share the gorgeous photos with her followers on Tuesday, August 9. Demi also gave insight into what she enjoys doing while on vacation with those closest and dearest.</p><p>She updated fans that she sunbathes, takes a dip in the water, reads “good” books and snoozes off when she gets a chance.</p><p>The <a href=#>movie</a> star captioned the photo with: “Paradise. Basking in the sun, playing in the water, naps with furry friends, and a good book”. Beside Demi is her chihuahua Pilaf, but it’s believed she may have as many as 10 rescue dogs. She also has a Yorkie and a Dachshund, and often shares snaps of the pack.</p><p>Behind the <a href=#>Hollywood</a> icon was a sensational view of the coast. Rich blue skies were on the horizon with clear water as well as faint indications of mountains. It’s proving to be the best backdrop for an Instagram photo dump.</p><p>While Demi’s full fit wasn’t in view, we can see her colorful bikini complimented her sun kissed complexion. She wore oversized shades to protect her from the sunshine and wore her hair back in a messy bun. No clouds were in sight – perfection.</p><p>In the second photo, she revealed her pedicure matched her swimsuit with bright red nail polish. It also unveiled she was relaxing next to a stunning infinity pool.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Paradise after supporting writer’s strike</h2><p>Demi, 60, divulged more picturesque snaps on her Instagram Stories, with a view of the coast and rippling water, delicious ripe tomatoes and told fans she’s currently got her nose in Mirinae Lee’s book, 8 Lives of a Century-Old Trickster.</p><p>Although the mom-of-three didn’t reveal where she’s jet setted off to, she recently showed <a href=# rel=nofollow>support</a> during the Writer’s Strike taking place in Hollywood.</p><p>The GI Jane actor was “proud” to walk with fellow SAG-AFTRA members, who are currently striking over a dispute on pay and job security. The labor strike currently underway with the American actors’ union is against the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers. It has coincided with the ongoing strike with the Writers Guild of America, pushing Hollywood into chaos. It’s seen TV shows on hiatus, like Netflix’s hit Stranger Things, as well as funny man Jimmy Fallon’s nighttime talk show.</p><p>It has dragged on since July 14 and doesn’t see any sign of stopping just yet. However, actors, comedians, movie stars and celebrity legends have come out to support all those striking.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmlwX2WGcLDEpqBmpZ%2Bkv6Z5y6impKtdqLKvv8CtoKimkaF6qrqMm6alnF2Xtqy1zaJksKCZobJuv9SnmZqsmJ67qHnIp2SpmaKWsaq%2FxGg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./6432cd47268e3ec1468b45a3-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Horario de misas hoy Domingo de Resurreccin en Mxico - 9 de abril 2023</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./craig-morgan-wake-up-loving-you.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Craig Morgan, Wake Up Loving You Song Review</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./20-year-sentence-2003-murder-ephrata-html.html>20-year sentence for 2003 murder in Ephrata</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./3-ways-can-remove-unwanted-blog-pages-google.html>3 Ways You Can Remove Unwanted Blog Pages From Google</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./5-rewarding-benefits-of-playing-the-violin.html>5 Rewarding Benefits of Playing the Violin</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./article-fbcffa51-ae5b-5b24-ba42-7821fc682093-html.html>Child molesters are the sweetest people | Columnists</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./woman-quells-racist-row-getting-boobs-train-html.html>Woman quells racist row by getting her boobs out on train</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaX.
