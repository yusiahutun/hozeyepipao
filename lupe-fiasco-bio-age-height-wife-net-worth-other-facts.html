Over the years he has been admired for the high lyrical content of his music, which mostly deals with topics such as gang violence, social injustice, and politics. One of his albums that strongly touched on these aspects was his seventh studio album Drogas Wave, which was released in September 2018. Besides rapping, Lupe is an established entrepreneur with an interest in the fashion world. Follow us as we reveal more facts about the rapper “The Show Goes On”.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Lupe Fiasco Bio (Age)</strong></h2><p>Lupe Fiasco was born on February 16, 1982, in Chicago, Illinois, to his parents Gregory and Shirley Wasalu Muhammad Jaco. Jaco and his 8 siblings grew up under relatively poor living conditions in the Madison Terrace housing project. Jaco got his musical side from his father Gregory, who was also a well-known drummer besides his work as a plant engineer.</p><p>His parents divorced when he was 5 years old, whereupon Jaco, who had grown up as a Muslim, lived with his mother. His father, however, remained an active part of his life, and he began living with him in a gang-dominated neighborhood in Harvey, Illinois, beginning in the 6th grade.</p><p>Gregory, also a karate grandmaster, abandoned his son to karate classes from the age of three and later taught him how to use a gun so he could defend himself against the gang members who plagued his neighborhood.</p><p>Jaco was encouraged by his parents to take academics seriously, and he grew up reading encyclopedias and National Geographic magazines. From his early teens, he cultivated a passion for music and began writing poetry, which he later turned into music. Although Lupe originally hated rap music for its use of vulgar words, after listening to Nas’s works he was inspired to start rapping.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Alex Wood Wife, Family, Salary, Height, Weight, MLB Career</a></strong></p><p>Lupe Fiasco began making his own music from his father’s basement at the age of 18. Later he became a member of the rap group Da Pak, which was signed to Epic Records shortly after. After the group split up, he started working as a solo act and got a contract with Arista Records. He was supposed to be dropped from the label after L.A. Reid’s dismissal.</p><p>However, Fiasco had stayed on the label long enough to meet Jay Z, who became a great admirer of his work. Jay Z helped him get a contract with Atlantic Records, and the rest is history.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Lupe Fiasco Net Worth</strong></h2><p>Lupe Fiasco made most of his wealth from his music career both as a rapper and as managing director of 1st and 15th Entertainment. Lupe has gone platinum on a number of his songs, most notably “The Show Goes On” from his first number one album “Lasers”. The single has since been awarded double platinum and remains his best-selling song. His albums “Lupe Fiasco’s The Cool” and “Lasers” received gold certification from the RIAA.</p><p>In addition to music, Lupe owns other business enterprises such as his fashion lines. He owns two fashion lines: Righteous Kung-Fu and Trilly & Truly. He was once a sneaker designer for Reebok. His net worth is estimated at 14 million dollars.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Wife</strong></h2><p>So far, the magnifying glass fiasco has never made it to the altar with a woman. The topic of his love life doesn’t come up often, and that’s because the rapper, unlike most celebrities, doesn’t do anything on social media to stimulate conversation about his love life.</p><p>This in no way implies that the fiasco is celibate. According to reports, the rapper has been in a relationship with the American model Dani Evans since 2013. Dani Evans is best known as the winner of America’s Next Top Model 2006 Cycle 6. They have been spotted occasionally at fashion and music events. The couple, however, largely holds back their relationship.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Grace Jones Biography, Son, Net Worth, Husband, Children and Family</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Height and Other Facts</strong></h2><ul><li>Lupe Fiasco stands at a height of 5 feet 10 inches high.</li><li>His name Lupe is simply the extension of the last two letters of his first name Wasalu.
