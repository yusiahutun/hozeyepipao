than a year in the job over a media scandal involving her <a href=#>family</a>.</p><p class=align-left>The respected former Wall Street executive's decision threatens to unsettle Turkey's recovery from a dire economic crisis that saw the annual inflation rate reach 85 percent in 2022.</p><p class=align-left>Erkan won major plaudits from <a href=#>Western</a> investors for spearheading a rapid series of interest rate hikes that helped stabilise the slumping lira and tame Turkey's dire cost of living crisis.</p><p class=align-left>Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan -- a lifelong opponent of high interest rates -- dropped his support for unconventional economics and repeatedly praised Erkan for her work.</p><p class=align-left>But the 44-year-old has came under withering attack on social media and in some opposition publications for allegedly allowing her father to make unauthorised personnel decisions at the <a href=#>bank</a>.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper

newspaper last month that she had to move in with her parents because inflation had made renting in Istanbul unaffordable.</p><p class=align-left>The attacks on Turkey's first woman central bank governor alarmed investors and created uncertainty about Erdogan's long-term commitment to his team.</p><p class=align-left>"A major reputation assassination campaign has recently been organised against me," Erkan said in a social media statement.</p><p class=align-left>"In order to prevent my family and my innocent child, who is not even one-and-a-half-years-old, from being further affected by this process, I have requested from our president to be pardoned from my duty, which I have been carrying out with honour since the first day."</p><h2>'We will continue'</h2><p class=align-left>Erdogan appointed Erkan just weeks after winning a tough May re-election in which his main opponent focused on Turkey's economic ills.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper

other market-friendly technocrats that Western analysts saw as Turkey's best bet at pulling itself back from the brink of economic doom.</p><p class=align-left>Their reforms have helped Turkey start winning back foreign investments and save the country from a potential banking crisis.</p><p class=align-left>Erkan resigned just a week after completing a historic <a href=#>series</a> of interest rate hikes that have taken the baseline rate from 8.5 percent to 45 percent.</p><p class=align-left>The bank said last week that it intends to keep rates high for the immediate future to make sure inflation is brought under control.</p><p class=align-left>Erkan's resignation puts the immediate focus on whether Erdogan intends to keep his pro-market team in place.</p><p class=align-left>Simsek called Erkan's decision "completely personal" and in no way reflective of Turkey's future economic course.</p><p class=align-left>"Our economic programme, carried out under the leadership of our President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, continues decisively and without interruption," he said in a statement.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px

could actually help Simsek and his team pursue their reformist programme by removing a distracting scandal.</p><p class=align-left>"I do not think that the resignation of the central bank governor will have a negative impact," Ankara's TOBB University of Economics and Technology professor Fatih Ozatay said.</p><p class=align-left>"Moreover, this is a development that will take the pressure off
