As it approaches being open for 70 years, the attraction is visited by approximately 19 million visitors each year. But behind the smiles and mascot Mickey Mouse what happens at Disneyland?

The park, which would have been located over seven acres, would have been called 'Walt Disney's America', not a particularly catchy name! Instead, Walt chose Anaheim, and the rest is history.</p></span><span class=clearfix></span></figure><h3>Poor initial reviews</h3><span><span class="text-muted tnt-update-old">Updated</span> Mar 12, 2024</span><figure class="photo layout-vertical letterbox-style-default"><span class=caption-text readability=33><p>Despite now being the world's most popular theme park, critics at the time were not impressed. Many reviews slated the park, and branded it "Walt's nightmare". Still, the public weren't put off. Thousands arrived in droves, with some even lining up outside its gates as early 2am.</p></span><span class=clearfix></span></figure><h3>The first ticket</h3><span><span class="text-muted tnt-update-old">Updated</span> Mar 12, 2024</span><figure class="photo layout-vertical letterbox-style-default"><span class=caption-text readability=33><p>When the park opened its doors, Walt Disney's brother, Roy O. Disney, bought the very first ticket – for a dollar! If fans want to visit the park now, they are looking at shelling out a minimum $104 for a one-day pass.</p></span><span class=clearfix></span></figure><h3>Teething problems</h3><span><span class="text-muted tnt-update-old">Updated</span> Mar 12, 2024</span><figure class="photo layout-vertical letterbox-style-default"><span class=caption-text readability=34><p>On the first day, Disneyland attracted an impressive 50,000 visitors. In fact, as more and more people piled in to the park, it became evident that it wasn't equipped well enough. Food and drink ran out quickly, rides broke down and the queue for the bathroom went on forever.</p></span><span class=clearfix></span></figure><h3>Stray cats in the castle</h3><span><span class="text-muted tnt-update-old">Updated</span> Mar 12, 2024</span><figure class="photo layout-vertical letterbox-style-default"><span class=caption-text readability=33><p>The park has become known for its 'Disneyland cats' who roam the establishment, but Walt wasn't initially keen to let them stay. In fact, the businessman first tried to get staff members to adopt them when he discovered that strays were sleeping in 'Sleeping Beauty's Castle' when it opened in 1955. Eventually, he decided to let them stay in an effort to keep pests to a minimum.</p></span><span class=clearfix></span></figure><h3>The most and least popular attractions</h3><span><span class="text-muted tnt-update-old">Updated</span> Mar 12, 2024</span><figure class="photo layout-vertical letterbox-style-default"><span class=caption-text readability=36><p>After debuting in 1967, 'Pirates of the Caribbean' has remained Disneyland's most popular attraction, having entertained roughly 330 million visitors. The ride proved so successful, that it spawned five movies of the same name, starring Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow (pictured). Sadly, not all rides are made equal. 'The Mickey Mouse Club Circus' opened in November 1955, and shut just two months later due to its poor visitor numbers.</p></span><span class=clearfix></span></figure><h3>Haunted attractions?</h3><span><span class="text-muted tnt-update-old">Updated</span> Mar 12, 2024</span><figure class="photo layout-vertical letterbox-style-default"><span class=caption-text readability=36><p>There certainly have been some spooky goings on at Disneyland. Both 'The Haunted Mansion' and the 'Pirates of the Caribbean' attractions had to be shut down after staff caught passengers spreading a mysterious powder on the sets, which police later identified as human ashes! Also, genuine human bones were on display at the 'Pirates of the Caribbean' when it opened in 1967. A number of attractions are also said to be home to ghosts, whilst the spectre of Walt himself has been reported to wonder around the park at night. The Haunted Mansion ride has spawned two films. The first adaptation was directed by Rob Minkoff, starring Eddie Murphy and was released in November 2003. The second adaptation, 'Haunted Mansion', was directed by Justin Simien and released in July 2023.</p></span><span class=clearfix></span></figure><h3>Famous staff</h3><span><span class="text-muted tnt-update-old">Updated</span> Mar 12, 2024</span><figure class="photo layout-vertical letterbox-style-default"><span class=caption-text readability=30><p>It seems like the Disney magic reached at least two of its workers. Both Steve Martin and Michelle Pfeiffer used to work at the park before becoming Hollywood icons. The 78-year-old comedian was a magician, whilst the 'Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania' actress played Alice in Wonderland.</p></span><span class=clearfix></span></figure><h3>Walt Disney's apartment</h3><span><span class="text-muted tnt-update-old">Updated</span> Mar 12, 2024</span><figure class="photo layout-vertical letterbox-style-default"><span class=caption-text readability=32><p>During the park's construction, Walt Disney decided to add an apartment above the fire station in an effort to keep commuting to a minimum. Although the visionary is no longer with us, visitors can still see the lamp which shines through the window, as a tasteful symbol of his legacy.</p></span><span class=clearfix></span></figure><h3>Walt Disney's magnum opus</h3><span><span class="text-muted tnt-update-old">Updated</span> Mar 12, 2024</span><figure class="photo layout-vertical letterbox-style-default"><span class=caption-text readability=35><p>Despite having created some of the most iconic characters and animated movies of all-time, Walt Disney insisted that Disneyland was his most important work, because it allowed him to leave behind a legacy that could "grow". He said: "When you wrap up a picture and turn it over to Technicolor, you’re through. 'Snow White' is a dead issue with me … I want something live, something that would grow. The park is that. Not only can I add things to it, but even the trees will keep growing. "The thing will get more beautiful year after year. And it will get better as I find out what the public likes. I can’t do that with a picture.”</p></span><span class=clearfix></span></figure><p class=exchange-source>Originally published on <a rel=noopener href=#>celebretainment.com</a>, part of the <a href=# rel=noopener>BLOX Digital Content Exchange</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHAnZyrZZOWua16wqikaKSZm7K0wNilnKxnYWV6p63CrapmsZ%2BqeqvB0q1kp52mmr9ut82ermaZkqTCtXnDoqqnnamhrq%2BwjpympaSVmMGqu82YbXBqlmavp7KMn26eal1qhaKvjJtubZtdmX9xr8Rvm51uYZuFb7TTpqM%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./assistant-of-ex-punk-manager-linda-stein-charged-in-her-murder.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Assistant Of Ex-Punk Manager, Linda Stein, Charged In Her Murder</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./what-is-hdmi.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>What Is HDMI?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./20-year-sentence-2003-murder-ephrata-html.html>20-year sentence for 2003 murder in Ephrata</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./3-ways-can-remove-unwanted-blog-pages-google.html>3 Ways You Can Remove Unwanted Blog Pages From Google</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./5-rewarding-benefits-of-playing-the-violin.html>5 Rewarding Benefits of Playing the Violin</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./article-fbcffa51-ae5b-5b24-ba42-7821fc682093-html.html>Child molesters are the sweetest people | Columnists</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./woman-quells-racist-row-getting-boobs-train-html.html>Woman quells racist row by getting her boobs out on train</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaX.
