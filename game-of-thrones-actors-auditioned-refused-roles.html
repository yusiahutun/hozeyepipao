But who were the actors who <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">auditioned or refused roles on <a href=# id=auto-tag_game-of-thrones data-tag=game-of-thrones>Game of Thrones</a></a>? With the premiere of the HBO series now over, we can’t help but look back at <a href=# rel=noopener>eight-plus years ago</a> when the show was still casting and finding the now-household-name actors who play Cersei Lannister, Sansa Stark and more. So, who were these actors who auditioned for Game of Thrones roles once upon a time. Well, they include a two-time Oscar winner (one of which was won in 2019), a former Hunger Games star and a cult-favorite actress from a beloved ’90s sci-fi.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Outlander.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Outlander.jpg><p>We can’t imagine anyone other than Maisie Williams, Nicolaj Coster-Waldau and Gwendoline Christie as Arya Stark, Jaime Lannister and Brienne of Tarth, but as Hollywood would have it, they weren’t the only actors to have auditioned for the roles. Several well-known stars have also considered Game of Thrones as their next career move, and though they weren’t offered the part in the end, their audition stories are still interesting to hear. From those who turned down the roles to actors who were recast after the pilot, check out the actors who were almost cast on Game of Thrones.</p><h2>Millie Bobby Brown — Lyanna Mormont</h2><p>Brown revealed in an interview on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon in October 2020 that she was almost <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">cast as Lyanna Mormont</a>&nbsp;(who was played by Bella Ramsey) in GOT. In the interview, Brown said that the rejection for the role almost led her to quit acting. Not too long later, she was cast in her breakout role as Eleven in Stranger Things.</p><p>“I think I was just very disheartened by the rejection. This industry is full of rejection, 24/7,” she said. “I was auditioning for commercials — for anything, really. I then auditioned for Game of Thrones and I got a ‘no’ for that, and then that’s when I was kind of like, ‘This is really difficult.’ I guess I really wanted that role.”</p><p>Brown went on to explain that she gave acting one more shot for a show called Montauk, which would later be retitled as Stranger Things. “One of my last goes at this all was this Netflix show called Montauk,” she said. “Montauk was definitely the one that gave me the hope of doing it all again.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/millie-bobby-brown-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/game-of-thrones-16.jpg><h2>Sam Claflin — Jon Snow, Viserys Targaryen</h2><p>Claflin, best known for his role as Finnick Odair in The Hunger Games franchise, revealed in a 2016 interview with Cinema Blend that he <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">auditioned for two Game of Thrones roles</a>: Jon Snow and Viserys Targaryen (Daenerys’s brother). “I think I speak on behalf of every British actor when I say, we all auditioned for it,” he said. Though Claflin wasn’t cast in the end, he doesn’t have FOMO. He told Cinema Blend that he’s happy to watch the show as a fan. “I like getting into things like that [as a viewer] and not being a part, because I always find it’s very jarring if I was part of it,” he said. “But I’m a big fan.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/sam-claflin.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/game-of-thrones-jon-2.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/game-of-thrones.jpg><h2>Gillian Anderson — Cersei Lannister</h2><p>Best known for her role in The X-Files, Anderson was offered the role of Cersei Lannister (played by Lena Headey) but turned it down. The offer came at the same time as an offer for Downton Abbey. “My 18-year-old cannot believe that I would turn down Game Of Thrones or Downton—things she loves to watch,” But if I am going to be spending that amount of time working on something I would rather be working with a director like Martin Scorsese,” she said. Anderson didn’t confirm which GOT character she was offered, but <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">fans have theorized</a> it was none other than Queen Cersei.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/gillian-anderson.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/game-of-thrones-cersei-2.jpg><h2>Tamzin Merchant — Daenerys Targaryen</h2><p>Merchant, best known for her role on The Tudors, was actually cast as Daenerys before Emilia Clarke and filmed a pilot of the show. She was recast after creators David Benioff and D.B. Weiss received a lot of negative feedback for the pilot and were forced to reshoot it. One of the big changes was the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">recasting of Daenerys</a>. “Watching them watch that original pilot was one of the most painful experiences of my life,” Weiss told Time of when he screened the pilot for some of his friends. “As soon as it finished, Craig [Mazin] said, ‘You guys have a massive problem.’” George R.R. Martin, who wrote the GOT books, has <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">praised Merchant’s acting on The Tudors</a> and spoke positively about her readings for the Mother of Dragons. No official reason has ever been given about her recasting.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/tamzin-merchant.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/game-of-thrones-daenerys-2.jpg><h2>Jennifer Ehle — Catelyn Stark</h2><p>Like Merchant, Ehle, who has starred in The King’s Speech and Fifty Shades of Grey, was <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">originally cast as Catelyn Stark</a> for GOT‘s pilot. She eventually turned down the role before it made it to series, so she could spend more time with her newborn daughter at the time, which is when Michelle Fairley was recast as the Stark matriarch. “It was too soon for me to be working, emotionally and bonding-wise, but I needed to do it and I was also passionate about the books,” she told the Daily Beast. “I loved the idea of telling that story.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/jennifer-ehle.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/game-of-thrones-2.jpg><h2>Mahershala Ali — Xaro Xhoan Daxos</h2><p>In a 2017 interview on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, Ali, who has won Oscars for his recent roles in Moonlight and Green Book, revealed that <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">he auditioned to play Xaro Xhoan Daxos</a>, a Qartheen merchant who Daenerys locks in a stone vault at the end of season 2. Because of the character’s storyline, he planned audition with chairs. But when he walked into the audition room, there were only stools. “I had this whole thing worked out with this chair. I was working with doing all these power moves and stances and what not. And then I go in for the audition and I walk into the HBO offices and there’s these two stools…with no back behind them,” he said before calling the experience “one of the worst auditions of my life.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/mahershala-ali.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/game-of-thrones-3.jpg><h2>Sam Heughan — Loras Tyrell, Renly Baratheon</h2><p>Heughan, best known for his role in Outlander, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">auditioned for several roles</a> including Loras Tyrell, Renly Baratheon and a few members of the Night’s Watch. In an interview with Vulture, he revealed that he auditioned for the show seven times. In the end, though, he isn’t mad that he wasn’t cast in any of the seven roles. He explained that the GOT audition experience gave him enough confidence to land the lead of Outlander. “I auditioned for Game of Thrones seven times! Loads of times. I auditioned for Renly, Loras, some of the members of the Night’s Watch. And I’d always get so close! I’d be like, ‘Guys, just give me a sword!’Everyone was going in for those parts,” he said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/sam-heughan.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/game-of-thrones-5.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/game-of-thrones-4.jpg><h2>Izzy Meikle-Small — Sansa Stark</h2><p>Meikle-Small, who’s starred in Never Let Me Go and Snow White and The Huntsman, was <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">almost cast as Sansa Stark</a>. She revealed that she was neck-in-neck with Sophie Turner, until HBO cut her in the final two. “I got to the final two to play Lady Sansa Sark,” she told The Telegraph in 2013. “I was a bit sad, because the show’s massive, but I’m not that unhappy, because they all show a lot of flesh, don’t they? I don’t think my parents would be happy.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/izzy-meikle-small.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/game-of-thrones-sansa-2.jpg><h2>Lily Allen — Yara Greyjoy</h2><p>Unlike the other actors on this list, Allen already has a connection to GOT. Her brother, Alfie Allen, plays Theon Greyjoy, so when HBO was casting for <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Theon’s sister, Yara Greyjoy,</a> the first person it went to was his real-life sister. “They asked me if I’d be interested in playing Theon’s sister,” Allen wrote on a Reddit AMA. In a 2014 interview with Vulture, Allen revealed that she turned down the offer after she learned that it would have to involve some inappropriate touching with her real-lie brother. “I felt uncomfortable because I would have had to go on a horse and he would have touched me up and shit,” Allen said. “Once they told me what was entailed, I said no thanks.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/lily-allen.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/game-of-thrones-6.jpg><h2>Charlie Hunnam — Rhaegar Targaryen</h2><p>In an interview with The Sun in 2017, Hunnam, best known for his role in Sons of Anarchy, revealed that he was <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">offered a cameo as Rhaegar Targaryen</a>, Daenerys’s older brother. Though he would’ve loved to do it, Hunnam revealed that he turned down the offer because he was filming something else at the time—however, he is still open to a cameo in the future. (Season 8?) “I would love to do a Game of Thrones cameo, they offered me a cameo on that show a little while ago but I was shooting something else so I wasn’t able to do it but maybe in the future, who knows,” he said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/charlie-hunnam.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/game-of-thrones-7.jpg><h2>Mark Strong — Stannis Baratheon</h2><p>According to Digital Spy, Strong, who starred as the villain in 2019’s Shazam!, was offered the role of Stannis Baratheon, played by Stephen Dillane. He turned down the role, however, after he was cast as the lead in AMC’s Low Winter Sun, which was canceled after one season. Strong hasn’t commented on the casting, but it’s been reported by several sites.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/mark-strong.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/game-of-thrones-8.jpg><p>A version of this article was originally published in April 2019.&nbsp;</p><p>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.
