When you consider <a href=#>how Saturn retrograde will affect each zodiac sign</a> for the next five months, you might realize that retrogrades can actually be helpful, motivating and realigning in so many ways.</p><p>With that being said, it’s understandable if the idea of a malefic planet like Saturn stationing retrograde sounds foreboding. Saturn is the planet of karma, restriction, commitment, responsibility and discipline, making it no walk around the park. Moving <a href=#>through Pisces since March 2023</a>, Saturn is currently reconstructing our world in an empathic, nebulous, emotional and idealistic water sign. This transit has been encouraging us to <a href=#>look beyond the fantasies</a> we escape to so that we can find a more grounded and practical truth in our spiritualities and imaginations. Saturn in Pisces does not want us to stop dreaming, but it does want us to <a href=#>dream more effectively</a>, meaningfully and intentionally.</p><p>Before you jump to negative conclusions, let’s remember that Saturn is retrograde <a href=#>almost 50% of the time</a>. Not only are you well-acquainted with this energy, but you probably won’t feel its full impact at first. That’s because the effects of Saturn retrograde tend to unfold gradually, revealing its influence over time. Unlike Mercury—an inner planet that governs day-to-day aspects of your life—Saturn is a generational planet that shapes the larger trends of your life.</p><p>Saturn will station retrograde at 7 degrees Pisces on June 17 at exactly 1:27 p.m. ET. Because the 7th degree is ruled by Libra—the zodiac sign of balance, harmony and one-on-one partnerships—this retrograde is likely to challenge our faith in our relationships and encourage us to be more honest with ourselves.</p><p>Saturn retrograde begins on June 17 and stations direct on November 4.</p><p>Retrogrades always turn a planet’s energy inward, which encourages a more introspective and reflective shift in Saturn’s approach. This retrograde could temper <a href=#>the harsh and heavy-handed impact</a> Saturn often has on our external reality, loosening us up enough to process all the lessons we’ve been learning since Saturn entered Pisces three months ago. When Saturn stations direct at exactly 0 degrees Pisces on November 4, you will be given a second chance to succeed at something you’ve been struggling to get right. Just give Saturn retrograde some time to help you ponder, process and form a new game plan. Think of it this way: Saturn in Pisces has been laying down the law. Saturn retrograde will help you learn how to abide by these laws (as well as work your way around them).</p><p>Here’s what you can expect from the upcoming Saturn retrograde, according to <a href=#>your sun</a> and/or <a href=#>rising sign</a> (and seriously, you’re missing out if you don’t read these horoscopes for your rising sign):</p><h2>How Saturn Retrograde Will Affect Each Zodiac Sign</h2><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.411149825784><h2>Aries</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Aries.png><p>Get ready to analyze and reflect on your secrets, dreams and fantasies, Aries. When Saturn stations retrograde in your 12th house of spirituality, it will force you to reassess your escapist tendencies and the unseen energies you would rather ignore. It’s time to take control of your subconscious understanding of the world before it takes control of you. You may feel distant and remote from the world, so think of this as your time to go underground and rise up better than ever. <a href=#>Read your full 2023 horoscope here</a>.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.8971255673222><h2>Taurus</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Taurus.png><p>This retrograde wants you to rethink your impact on others and the way others impact you. As Saturn retraces its steps through your 11th house of community, it could bring rise to the issues you’ve been experiencing in your social circle and extended network, forcing you to reexamine the ideas you share with others, as well as the people you choose to share those ideas with. Don’t forget the power of community, especially if its one you feel truly aligned with. A loyal and supportive team will elevate you, but a group of jealous haters will only hold you back. <a href=#>Read your full 2023 horoscope here</a>.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0.93960923623446><h2>Gemini</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Gemini.png><p>The pressure is on, because Saturn has been forcing you to get serious about your goals and ambitions for the past few months. Now that Saturn is stationing retrograde in your 10th house of career, you’re getting a bit of a break from all the new limitations and restrictions you’ve been dealing with as of late. Give yourself time to process the new responsibilities you’ve taken on, as this retrograde is giving you a chance to get back into a professional groove. <a href=#>Read your full 2023 horoscope here</a>.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0.93436293436293><h2>Cancer</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Cancer.png><p>If you’ve been feeling boxed in and constrained lately, it may have something to do with Saturn setting boundaries in your ninth house of experiences and expansion. And now that Saturn is stationing retrograde, you’re beginning to realize that even when you can’t find an adventure elsewhere, it can always be found within.

Now that Saturn is retrograding, you may find yourself reflecting on how your investments are currently taking shape and processing the new reality these boundaries have helped you create. By the time this retrograde is over, you may find that some of these boundaries may be too strict (or not strict enough). <a href=#>Read your full 2023 horoscope here</a>.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.4234234234234><h2>Virgo</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Virgo.png><p>This retrograde will have a major impact on you, Virgo. After all, Saturn is stationing retrograde in Pisces—your opposite sign—and it will oppose Virgo all throughout the end of summer and beginning of autumn. Don’t think the worst is going to happen, as this retrograde will give you a break from some of the major relationship changes and developments you’ve been processing for the past few months.

Saturn is simply forcing you to raise your standards for love, pleasure and creative enjoyment. If the things that used to make you happy just aren’t cutting it anymore, this retrograde will be a beautiful time for you to experiment with new hobbies and projects.

This transit has been showing you the consequences of what you say, what you think and how you communicate. And with Saturn stationing retrograde, you may find yourself internalizing some of these realizations you’ve been making. Sometimes, it’s important to slow down so everything else can catch up.
