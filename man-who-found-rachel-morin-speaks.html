The two and one of his daughter's friends discovered the worst, finding her body in a drain.</p><p>"I kept telling them to search the tunnels because I had a feeling about those tunnels," Gabriszeski told WMAR. "I walked forward to search one tunnel and they searched the one and that's where they found her."</p><p>According to the report, the state of her body led him to believe she was murdered.</p><p>"Something like this should not happen in Harford County. Hopefully [they] catch the person who did the trifling act.

While he was hesitant to reveal what they found at the scene, he said there were "indicators" of murder and detectives "have no doubt" they're "sadly" dealing with a homicide case.</p><p>"Detectives continue to work the case as aggressively as we possibly can," he continued, saying that, "at this point in time, there is not a suspect." He later reiterated, "There's nobody that I would put and say this person is a possible suspect, zero."</p><p>After noting how much attention the office's notice to the public about Morin's disappearance generated, he also cautioned those following the case to "be careful in what they share in their comments and make sure it's factual."</p><p>While authorities stated during the press conference that they had no possible suspects on Sunday, many went to the Facebook page of Morin's boyfriend to speculate about his possible involvement in the comments.</p><p>According to a post to Morin's Facebook page on August 3, she has been dating Richard Tobin for at least a few weeks. Her post at the time was the first one about him, writing, "Only started taking pics few weeks ago.. but these are a few of my favorites. From the beach to the mountains."</p><p>On August 1, Morin also changed his relationship status to say the two were dating.</p><p>Since then, the post has been flooded with comments from people who don't appear to know the couple at all and only landed on his page because of the case. At the time of publishing, the post had 430 comments -- some speculating about his possible involvement, others warning commenters against doing just that -- with Tobin now limiting who's able to leave a message on it.</p><p>He also commented as well, writing, "I love Rachel, I would never do anything to her, let the family and I grieve. Yes I have a past but I also have 15 months clean and have changed as a person. Please."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7j3FmaXFfoq6vedahpmaen6q7pXnRmpqhnZxiurC%2ByKdkrKiVlri0ew%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./nicaraguan-migrant-deported-raping-disabled-woman-jailed-demon-possession-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Nicaraguan migrant, 40, who has been deported from the US FIVE TIMES is jailed for 19 years for rapi</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./florida-georgia-line-cancel-2021-tour.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Florida Georgia Line Cancel 2021 Tour</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./20-year-sentence-2003-murder-ephrata-html.html>20-year sentence for 2003 murder in Ephrata</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./3-ways-can-remove-unwanted-blog-pages-google.html>3 Ways You Can Remove Unwanted Blog Pages From Google</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./5-rewarding-benefits-of-playing-the-violin.html>5 Rewarding Benefits of Playing the Violin</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./article-fbcffa51-ae5b-5b24-ba42-7821fc682093-html.html>Child molesters are the sweetest people | Columnists</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./woman-quells-racist-row-getting-boobs-train-html.html>Woman quells racist row by getting her boobs out on train</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaX.
