Food producer Nichirei also stepped in to supply the frozen food – including beef, pork, chicken, salmon, shrimp and spinach – for the 1964 Games, its spokesperson said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Tanaka believes this resulted in broader acceptance of frozen food in Japan, and eventually led to the industry being worth 7.13 billion yen (US$64.7 million) by 2019. These figures from the Japan Frozen Food Association further revealed that the consumption of frozen food grew to 2.95 billion tonnes by 2019, up by close to 38 times from 1968.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Refrigerators, as with other electrical goods such as televisions and washing machines, quickly became commonplace in Japan by the end of the 1960s. Today, Japan’s most popular prepared frozen foods include croquettes, noodles, rice products, cutlets and hamburger pattie<strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-1 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">s.</strong></p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Tasting party</strong></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Japan’s first commercial frozen food – a strawberry dessert known as Ichigo Shahbe – was launched for sale in 1930. On the country’s first Antarctic expedition in 1957, the crew took with them about 20 tonnes of frozen food supplied by Nichirei.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But, as the company spokesperson put it, frozen food had a bad reputation back then.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“After World War II, the distribution of frozen fish in Japan grew but the produce was stale, leading to the image that frozen foods were of poor quality and less delicious,” he said.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">From robots to self-driving cars, Olympics will showcase Japan’s tech prowess</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Marc Matsumoto, a Tokyo-based culinary consultant, said besides the taste factor and the low availability of freezers for home use before 1964, traditional perceptions of a woman’s role in the home also contributed to the initial aversion to frozen food.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Serving ready-to-eat foods was seen as an abdication of responsibility, and in tight-knit communities, it would have been considered shameful to be seen purchasing such products,” he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">To dispel these misconceptions, Murakami’s team held a tasting party for his Olympics menu in 1963. It was a high-level meeting attended by officials including Eisaku Sato, who would later become Japan’s prime minister.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/07/23/d138b564-332e-450d-9370-b973432b0dbc_b45a9a13.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Roast beef and grilled lobster were among the delicacies offered – and the twist was that some of the dishes had been prepared with frozen ingredients, without attendees being told.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">After sampling the food, Sato said it was delicious. It was just what Murakami’s team needed to greenlight their plan.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">High-quality convenience</strong></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Matsumoto, who works on menu development and marketing with food brands, attests to the quality of frozen cuisine in Japan today – even though it is considered convenience food.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">As Olympic athletes gear up to compete, can they beat Japan’s heat?</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The level of quality is high enough that [frozen food] has become a suitable alternative to cooking or dining out. Even homes that cook most of their meals may use ready-to-eat frozen items to supplement home-cooked dishes,” he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“For example, ramen comes with al dente noodles with all the traditional toppings – no telltale signs of being frozen and reheated, such as dry meat or soggy vegetables. Even sushi can be frozen, a technical marvel given that rice has a tendency to retrograde and get hard when chilled, and frozen fish tends to secrete fluids, creating drip loss that would ordinarily seep into the rice.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Besides frozen food becoming the norm in Japanese kitchens after 1964, the work processes instituted to feed thousands during the Games also influenced the hotel industry.</p><img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2021/07/22/thumbnail_-_clean.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewDuration class="css-dkee4u eaw92su1">03:22</p><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewTitle class="css-1ajvbe4 eaw92su2">How much will a lack of tourists at the Tokyo Olympics cost Japan?</p><p>How much will a lack of tourists at the Tokyo Olympics cost Japan?</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Having a central kitchen is one of the legacies from the 1964 Olympics. At that time, making one meal involved the chef from the beginning to the end. But with the central kitchen system, it became possible to partially cook the ingredients in advance, store them and send them to each department as needed,” said Tanaka from the Imperial Hotel.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">For the 2020 Games, Tanaka has collaborated with catering companies to craft more than 700 dishes to be served at the Olympic Village. Cafeterias – some open around the clock – will serve 48,000 meals a day, with menus ranging from Western to Japanese to Indian, Vietnamese and Chinese.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Having joined the Imperial Hotel because of Murakami, Tanaka is proud to be involved in the Games this year.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">At the Imperial Hotel, the most commonly used frozen food is seafood. The meat used is chilled, not frozen, while the kitchen relies on frozen vegetables if it is preparing for a banquet involving 2,000 to 3,000 participants.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As for this year’s games, the organisers have confirmed that a large amount of frozen foodstuffs will be used.</p>“Due to the need to prepare a large number of meals in a short period of time, we will be procuring ingredients including meat and fish in large batches,” said a <a class="d8-auto-link euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Tokyo 2020</span></a> spokesperson. “Frozen processed food such as dim sum is also being offered.”<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Additional reporting by Cyril Ip</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kxKaxymaYrKGRZLmqssSsq7KklWKwtrjTrqmeZ5Gnwaqvy55mbGlkZ4Bzfo6hprBlmpa9orrErJxmm5ias7R5xLGnnqqZorKvwIxqcG9sXam8rMXOZqalsZ2ltqS%2F</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./khloe-kardashian-healthy-journey-after-amy-schumer-snl-diss-20151210.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Khloe Kardashian Talks &amp;quot;Healthy Journey&amp;quot; After Amy Schumer SNL Diss</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./433597-congratulations-a-father-100-messages-wishes-quotes.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Congratulations on becoming a father! 100+ messages, wishes, and quotes</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./20-year-sentence-2003-murder-ephrata-html.html>20-year sentence for 2003 murder in Ephrata</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./3-ways-can-remove-unwanted-blog-pages-google.html>3 Ways You Can Remove Unwanted Blog Pages From Google</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./5-rewarding-benefits-of-playing-the-violin.html>5 Rewarding Benefits of Playing the Violin</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./article-fbcffa51-ae5b-5b24-ba42-7821fc682093-html.html>Child molesters are the sweetest people | Columnists</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./woman-quells-racist-row-getting-boobs-train-html.html>Woman quells racist row by getting her boobs out on train</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaX.
