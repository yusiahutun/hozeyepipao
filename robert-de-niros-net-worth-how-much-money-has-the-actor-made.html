The beloved actor and director has appeared in countless hit films, including <a href=#>Taxi Driver</a>, <a href=#>Goodfellas</a>, The Irishman and Casino, and his extraordinary net worth is just one indication of his undeniable success.</p><p>Robert is estimated to be worth more than $500 million, according to <a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a>. Not only did he land gigs in classic award-winning films when he was younger, but the Meet the Parents alum has continued to act in Hollywood for more than five decades.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/robert-deniros-net-worth-how-much-money-does-he-make02.jpg><p>The Raging Bull star was bit by the acting bug at a very young age. After making his stage debut as the Cowardly Lion in his school’s production of The Wizard of Oz at just 10 years old, he dropped out of high school at 16 to chase his dreams of becoming a star. By 20, he landed his first major movie role in 1969’s The Wedding Party.</p><p>From that moment on, Robert’s Hollywood career completely took off. He became a household name following his portrayal of Vito Corleone in The Godfather: Part II in 1974, followed by a major success in 1976’s Taxi Driver. This led to starring roles in 1977’s New York, New York, 1978’s The Deer Hunter, 1980’s Raging Bull and 1987’s The Untouchables.</p><p>By the ’90s, Robert had already starred in countless memorable films, as well as taken home two <a href=#>Academy Awards</a> for his parts in Raging Bull and The Godfather: Part II, but this certainly wasn’t the end of his legendary run. In fact, he briefly reinvented his career when he made his directorial debut with <a href=#>A Bronx Tale</a> in 1993.</p><p>Though Robert didn’t return to his directing role until 2006’s The Good Shepherd, he continued focusing on his work in front of the camera. He picked up credits in Casino, Marvin’s Room, Meet the Parents, City By the Sea and Stardust. To this day, he’s appeared in more than 120 films and TV shows, and <a href=#>has also received</a> two <a href=#>Golden Globes</a>, one <a href=#>SAG Award</a> and multiple Emmy nominations on top of his already two Oscars.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/robert-deniros-net-worth-how-much-money-does-he-make.jpg><p>In addition to acting and directing, Robert has made a ton of money as a businessman. In the mid-’90s, he started his restaurant empire with <strong>Nobu Matsuhisa</strong> when they opened their first Nobu eatery in New York City. Nowadays, the chain is highly popular amongst famous celebs and has more than 40 locations around the world. Robert also co-owns The Greenwich Hotel in New York.</p><p>Robert’s latest business venture came in 2017 when he announced a plan to construct a luxury resort called “Paradise Found” in Barbuda with Australian billionaire <strong>James Packer</strong>. According to <a href=#>The Caribbean Radio</a>, the resort was set to be a “quarter-of-a-billion dollar complex” with more than 56 villas and cottages to rent in total. However, the <a href=#>Guardian</a> reported all construction work was suspended after a high court determined the resort would pose a negative effect on the ecosystem in August 2018.</p><p>Knowing Robert, he’ll find plenty of other ways to make money!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46rppudoql6pbGMp6Crp6Niu6bAjLCmq6yYYrWww4ymrJygXaK8r7HYZp%2Baq12ptaZ5wJyrqKpdoq6lsY4%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./steve-harvey-unrecognizable-transformation-no-mustache.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Steve Harvey looks unrecognizable without his mustache and fans are divided</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./meet-shawn-howell-wayans-the-celebrity-kid-everyone-wants-to-know-about.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Meet Shawn Howell Wayans, the Celebrity Kid Everyone Wants To Know About</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./20-year-sentence-2003-murder-ephrata-html.html>20-year sentence for 2003 murder in Ephrata</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./3-ways-can-remove-unwanted-blog-pages-google.html>3 Ways You Can Remove Unwanted Blog Pages From Google</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./5-rewarding-benefits-of-playing-the-violin.html>5 Rewarding Benefits of Playing the Violin</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./article-fbcffa51-ae5b-5b24-ba42-7821fc682093-html.html>Child molesters are the sweetest people | Columnists</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./woman-quells-racist-row-getting-boobs-train-html.html>Woman quells racist row by getting her boobs out on train</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaX.
