She allegedly showed the videos to a co-worker at Pizza Inn and told her "that she was going to shoot 400 people for fun" and that there were "so many people at her old school that she would like to do it to".</p><p>The co-worker reported the incident to her manager, who then called the police.</p><p>"In today's times, you can't say stuff like that," Pittsburg County Sheriff Chris Morris told <a href=#><strong>KTUL</strong></a>. "We're going to take it serious and investigate it to the fullest extent and make an arrest if possible because we do not want any of our schools getting shot up - nobody does."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:72a024ee-920c-5c3f-b444-ef919e37e280 data-container-ref=toofab:article:be5364b2-0a23-58f3-8b77-4e4979dd3e09 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/a6/5by4/2019/09/17/a6cfe7bea13952e78ad20bfd123938e6_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Granville County PD</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Sheriff Who Allegedly Plotted to Murder His Own Deputy</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Police went to Wilson's home and recovered an "iPhone with a purple case, an AK-47 with six magazines and a 12-gauge shotgun with a stock sleeve for extra shells" from her bedroom.</p><p>When interviewed, Wilson appeared "nervous" as she denied making the threat, according to investigative officers.</p><p>"She said that she would never shoot up a school or people and that her co-worker must have taken what she said wrong," Deputy Matthew Jordan wrote in his report.</p><p>But by the end of the interview, Wilson told Jordan she felt “suicidal and borderline homicidal” toward her classmates at McAlester High because of the bullying she suffered.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:11fcecd4-2663-51ab-acbb-5f0dbe4b291e data-container-ref=toofab:article:be5364b2-0a23-58f3-8b77-4e4979dd3e09 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/d9/5by4/2019/09/14/d98ea037d761535f8c6c43e46fa32d3f_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Idaho Statesman</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Former Idaho Governor Candidate Probed In 1984 Murder of 12-Year-Old Girl: 'I Have Nothing To Hide'</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>According to a resource officer at McAlester, Wilson had previous incidents at the school dating back to 2013. She had been suspended once for bringing a knife to class and again for having swastika symbols on her personal belongings.</p><p>"I am saddened that we live in a world where every threat could be credible," Randy Hughes, superintendent of McAlester Public Schools, said in a statement following Wilson's arrest.</p><p>"I am grateful for the quick response from the Pittsburg County Sheriff's Department and the McAlester Police Department in the way they handled this situation. Together they helped to (avert) a very potentially dangerous situation."</p><p>Wilson's bond was set at $250,000. She's due in court on September 27, court records revealed.</p><p><strong>Got a story or a tip for us?
