Sitting on a bench along the River Seine in Paris, wearing a black knit vest and a brown LV monogram leather cap, comedian Jerrod Carmichael asks artist Henry Taylor, “Do you admit to yourself how bad you want it?” Carmichael slams the back of his hand against his palm. “Sometimes I don’t say, like, truly how badly I want it.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Actions speak louder than words,” says Taylor, apologizing for the cliché.

Instead, much was said of Williams. Online, fashion fans and music fans duked it out over whether a famous hip-hop multi-hyphenate made sense in one of the top design jobs in the industry. But everyone could agree the hiring indicated a shift of Louis Vuitton’s focus, one that placed culture at the center.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Leading up to the show, Pietro Beccari, who was appointed CEO of the house in January, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/18/style/louis-vuitton-menswear-pharrell-williams-louis-vuittons.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="told " class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">told </a><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/18/style/louis-vuitton-menswear-pharrell-williams-louis-vuittons.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The New York Times" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">The New York Times</a>, “It was important that we found someone having a broader spectrum than being a very fantastic designer, which is great for the industry and we have many of them.” Later on in the piece, Williams would go on to mention that he has no delusions about who he is and what he is capable of: “I am a creative designer from the perspective of the consumer. I didn’t go to Central Saint Martins. But I definitely went to the stores and purchased, and I know what I like.”</p><img alt="a model on the runway at the louis vuitton menswear collection fashion show on june 20, 2023 in paris, france photo by giovanni giannoniwwd via getty images" title="Louis Vuitton Spring 2024 Menswear Collection Runway Show, Paris" width=2991 height=4486 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1258879916-649327e8d83b0.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Giovanni Giannoni</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">His first designs for the house fit this framework. Covered in the brand’s signature prints and monograms, they telegraphed Louis Vuitton from a distance. But they were also imbued with a sense of impenitent joy that was paramount to the show. A handful of the first models wore tailored suits with matching shorts, a look Williams has become personally associated with on the red carpet. Others wore rain boots and carried mini trunks covered in a digitized version of Vuitton’s Damier check pattern, the original of which was reimagined in jacquard and pearl embroidery throughout. The classic Speedy bag was revived in bright primary colors and dangled along long legs ending in chunky socks and lug-soled T-strap Mary Janes.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">They are the kind of pieces a customer might save up for to prove to themselves and those around them that they’ve made it. They are bold, like the types of looks our favorite artists pull together to stand out on the red carpet. They are why “quiet luxury” can only ever go so far—because the pleasures of perceived opulence are far more relatable, whether anyone cares to admit it or not.</p><img alt="paris, france june 20 a model walks the runway during the louis vuitton ready to wear springsummer 2024 fashion show as part of the paris men fashion week on june 20, 2023 in paris, france photo by victor virgilegamma rapho via getty images" title="Louis Vuitton - Runway - Spring/Summer 2024 Paris Men Fashion Week" width=2837 height=4256 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1500234677-6493288559fd4.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Victor Virgile</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Williams is considered one of the best-dressed men in music, and his own personal style clearly served as inspiration for a handful of looks, perhaps none more obvious than that worn by former Saint Laurent creative director Stefano Pilati. Pilati’s glasses were lined in pearls that framed his eyes, his tailored jacket embroidered in pearl Damier and styled with pleated wool shorts. While being self-referential can be perceived as egotistical, it doesn’t feel that way when Williams does it. There’s an undeniable earnestness to it, as if he’s telling us: I know you want to dress like your favorite artist—and that’s fine!</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It’s why a couple of days before his debut, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a44222387/rihanna-baby-bump-louis-vuitton-campaign/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="he rolled out an ad campaign" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">he rolled out an ad campaign</a> starring Rihanna in an unbuttoned leather button-down with her pregnant belly exposed and colorful green, yellow and red Speedy bags nestled in the crooks of her elbows. Her name trended for days after, indicating a true cultural moment—which is exactly what Williams seems to be promising to give the brand. There are plenty of designers creating works of art that reflect our reality, or gorgeous shapes that consumers want to feel on their bodies, but there aren’t many who have been able to deliver these kinds of pop culture escapes. It’s why today’s youth are enamored with the red carpet of the early 2000s. It represents something unserious and fun: glamour without complications.</p><img alt="paris, france june 20 a model walks the runway during the louis vuitton ready to wear springsummer 2024 fashion show as part of the paris men fashion week on june 20, 2023 in paris, france photo by victor virgilegamma rapho via getty images" title="Louis Vuitton - Runway - Spring/Summer 2024 Paris Men Fashion Week" width=2833 height=4256 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1500227295-6493275e80cb1.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Victor Virgile</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Recent Louis Vuitton designers, particularly Marc Jacobs and Abloh, have a history of providing fashion fit for the moment. Throughout his collection, Williams nodded to their work, including Jacobs’s top-handle Alma bag silhouettes, which became paparazzi photo staples in the Aughts. He created his digital camouflage print as an homage to a 2019 pixelated pattern first introduced by Abloh. And he introduced a bit of himself, with an LVERS emblem on varsity jackets that references the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.virginia.org/plan-your-trip/virginia-is-for-lovers/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="“Virginia Is for Lovers”" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">“Virginia Is for Lovers”</a> slogan of his home state. The bold Speedys were meant to evoke dupe culture—picture fake bags in colors you know a house doesn’t produce lining the sidewalk of Canal Street. While Williams brings plenty of star power—Zendaya, Beyoncé, and Jay-Z were in the front row in Paris—there was also a sense that he wants his Louis Vuitton to be for everyone, old fans of the brand and new.<br></p><img alt="paris, france june 20 editorial use only for non editorial use please seek approval from fashion house louis vuitton mens creative director pharrell williams acknowledges the applause of the audience after the louis vuitton menswear springsummer 2024 show as part of paris fashion week on june 20, 2023 in paris, france photo by aurelien meuniergetty images" title="Louis Vuitton: Runway - Paris Fashion Week - Menswear Spring/Summer 2024" width=4819 height=3211 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1500127788-649328e2a8a08.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Aurelien Meunier</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Williams also just seemed to want to have fun, with a choir at the end of the runway creating a celebratory tone. When he came out to take his bow, he brought his entire design team with him. He spent more than five minutes on the runway, soaking in the moment with a genuine exuberance that’s rare in the fashion industry. It’s clear he’d been dreaming of this moment, and he wasn’t afraid to show how badly he wanted it.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 e1jtuqk11"></span><h5 class="css-13733z5 e1jtuqk13">Louis Vuitton Spring 2024 Menswear</h5><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 e1jtuqk10"></span><img alt="louis vuitton" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/louis-vuitton-mens-spring-summer-2024-look-1-64932ab623d95.jpg title="louis vuitton" width=1600 height=2000 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center>Open Gallery<span class="css-1w4f7je es31yw60"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/arrow-right.7440adc.svg alt title="Black right arrow" width=100% height=auto decoding=async role=img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/a3e534fd-dc82-4b22-be80-50efa84b1924_1663767759.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Tara Gonzalez" title="Headshot of Tara Gonzalez" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Tara Gonzalez is the Senior Fashion Editor at Harper’s Bazaar.
