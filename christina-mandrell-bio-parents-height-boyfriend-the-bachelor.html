So, she missed out on the dating adventures that one talks about with their friends’ circle. However, it’s never too late to revigorate your love life. Now, that Christina is divorced, she’s looking for a brand new adventure and has joined </span><i><span>The Bachelor</span></i><span>.</span></p><p><span>This Christina Mandrell Bio is all about her.</span></p><h3><b>Christina Mandrell On The Bachelor 27</b></h3><p><span>Finally,</span><i><span> The Bachelor</span></i><span> season 27 has returned with 30 women including Christina Mandrell, and this time the new heartthrob is Zach Shallcross. He was a contestant who self-eliminated after his fantasy suite date with Season 19 </span><i><span>Bachelorette</span></i><span> Rachel Recchia didn’t go as planned.</span></p><p><span>As for our star, Christina is a newly divorced mom ready for her perfect, fairytale love story. She was looking for a partner she can trust unconditionally and is open-minded to whatever life throws their way. And obviously, she believed that was Zach.</span></p><p><span>However, this season, Zach was keeping his heart in check. After his experience as a contestant on </span><i><span>The Bachelorette</span></i><span>, the charmer now realizes that he is the “guy that typically wears his heart on his sleeve.” So, he was treading carefully as he knew he falls in love really “hard and really fast and doesn’t necessarily take a step back and look at the entire situation from her perspective.”</span></p><p><b>Spoiler Alert:</b><span> As a result, Christina was eliminated at the third Rose Ceremony. But then again, given Christina’s drinking habit — which also became a storyline on </span><i><span>The Bachelor </span></i><span>after she drank a lot on Night One, as well as sleeping on the stairs of the Bachelor Mansion at a pool party in week three — it was only natural Zach would let her go.</span></p><p><span>Before her elimination, Christina also got into a fight with Brianna after she told her that the “First Impression Rose” she received was from America and not Zach. For this, Christina was even labeled a “bully” by the fans.</span></p><p><span>“We know Christina is going to be a polarizing figure in the first three episodes. In the back half of the season, that role will pretty much be taken over by Brooklyn. Just heard she was a pot stirrer and was in the middle of a lot of drama,” Reality Steve reported in January 2023.</span></p><p><span>For those of you curious, Zach’s final four were Gabi Elnicki, Ariel Frenkel, Charity Lawson, and Kaity Biggar, according to Reality Steve. Reportedly, Zach even visited all of their hometowns.</span></p><h3><b>Christina Mandrell Daughter</b></h3><p><span>Christina Mandrel welcomed her daughter, Blakely, into this world in December 2016 with her now ex-husband William B. ”Blake” Dennis @</span><a href=#><span>blake_dennis1</span></a><span>.</span></p><p><span>She and William were high school sweethearts who started dating in June 2012. The duo then tied the knot back in May 2015 and divorced in May 2021 — five months after their split.</span></p><p><span>As per the court documents, Christina was the one to file for divorce. She cited “irreconcilable differences” and accused Blake of “inappropriate marital conduct.”</span></p><p><span>Now, while Christina’s searching for love, Blake’s dating Sydney Freeman @</span><a href=#><span>sydneyyfreeman</span></a><span>. And surprisingly, Christina and Sydney seem to be quite comfortable with each other. In an August 2022 IG post, Christina shared a video of her and Sydney hanging out with Blakely. “People who have slumber parties with their ex-husband’s new girlfriend,” the caption read.</span></p><p><span>Also, a month before, she said another post of herself hanging out with Blake and Sydney, captioned, “ “When your ex-husband and his girlfriend start bickering.”</span></p><h3><b>Christina Mandrell Boyfriend</b></h3><p><span>Christina Mandrell didn’t seem to be dating in 2023. Unfortunately, she couldn’t also find love on </span><i><span>The Bachelor</span></i><span> season 27.</span></p><p><span>So, this means she’s still looking for a boyfriend who “she can trust unconditionally and is open-minded to whatever life throws their way.”</span></p><h3><b>How Old Is Christina Mandrell?</b></h3><p><span>Christina Mandrell stepped into this world on October 19, 1995. That made her 27 years of age when she appeared on </span><i><span>The Bachelor</span></i><span> in 2023.</span></p><p><span>However, she was a year younger when she filmed the show.</span></p><p><span>As per her birthday, Christina is of the Libra zodiac.</span></p><h3><b>Who Are Christina Mandrell Parents?</b></h3><p><span>Christina Mandrel was born to her parents Irlene Mandrell and Rob Pincus. Sadly, they divorced in 2004 after 8 years of marriage.</span></p><p><span>If you’re a fan of NBC’s </span><i><span>Barbara Mandrell & the Mandrell Sisters</span></i><span>, you might have also seen Christina’s mom and aunts on the show.</span></p><p><span>Her mom, Irlene is a Musician, Actress, Author, and Host of the God Rains Miracles Radio Show. She was born on January 29, 1956, in Corpus Christi, Texas, USA, and is popular for her appearances on </span><i><span>The Misadventures of Amy Everhart </span></i><span>(1999), </span><i><span>Every Other Holiday</span></i><span> (2018), and </span><i><span>A Belle for Christmas </span></i><span>(2014).</span></p><p><span>Before marrying, Christina’s dad, Irlene was married to Richard Boyer for 5 years. She also bears 2 children Vanessa and Deric Boyer from her previous marriage.</span></p><p><span>As for Christina’s father, Rob is an Educator, Author, and Entrepreneur in the personal defense field with over 20yrs professional experience.
