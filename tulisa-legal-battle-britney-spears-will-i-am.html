Tulisa revealed that the single was originally planned for her debut album before it was given to Britney, who had enormous success with the song, particularly as it marked her first UK number one in the charts in eight years. According to reports, the former X Factor judge has now been awarded 10 per cent of the publishing rights and income for all profits the song has secured since its release in 2012.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/908d41467075-tulisa-court-z.jpg><p id=el7tiBqZjE5G data-wc=55>will.i.am has previously spoken about Tulisa's involvement in the track, saying: "Tulisa wrote to that song before I did – this is the truth. But the producers of the beat… didn't want her to have it." Tulisa also claimed that her vocals are still on the track, which was also backed-up by a musicologist report.&nbsp;</p><p id=ed7uYo5i4e data-wc=82>Speaking about the 29-year-old's success, a source told the MailOnline: "Tulisa was annoyed when the song was taken from her and given to Britney - especially as she co-wrote it. It was set to be one of the big songs on her debut album. She didn't let it lie, and took it all the way to the courts and has now won. She just wanted to be recognised as the writer of one of the biggest pop tracks of the last decade."</p><p id=eKp3i6xnh0hS data-wc=15><a class=hm-link href=#>READ: Joshua Sasse appears to make thinly-veiled dig at Kylie Minogue in cryptic Instagram post</a></p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff></figure><p id=etdn80G7_w74 data-wc=34>Tulisa has stayed out of the public spotlight in recent months, but appears to be returning to work as a performer after she was spotted leaving Universal Music offices with her manager in March.&nbsp;</p><p id=eSZ3FlMVLb data-wc=62>Previously speaking about a difficult period in her life on , she said: "I think hard times either bring out the best in you or the worst, and I think I've luckily managed to bring out all the positives in myself.
