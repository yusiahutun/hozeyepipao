It aims to counter the multi-billion-dollar diet industry – which has a poor record when it comes to long-term, sustainable weight loss – and act as an antidote to the stigma encountered by people struggling with their weight.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The idea is that, rather than shame overweight people and force them to diet, they should be encouraged to embrace their bodies, find exercises they enjoy and eat more nutritionally. But some say those philosophies have been taken to extremes, particularly on social media, by celebrating morbid obesity while ignoring its serious health dangers.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The US edition of Cosmopolitan magazine was criticised for running covers featuring plus-size women in yoga poses under the headline: 'This is healthy.' As part of a drive to challenge beauty stereotypes, it also featured US plus-size model Tess Holliday – who at 5ft 3in and 300lb has a BMI of 53, more than double the healthy range – a decision condemned 'as dangerous and misguided'.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Self-styled 'fat activists', meanwhile, not only promote larger bodies as healthy but reject decades of science which prove the dangers of excess body fat, encouraging devotees to ignore doctors who recommend they lose weight.</p><img id=i-79f8d3d8c3af53b0 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/12/16/20/79036287-0-image-a-21_1702758721150.jpg height=634 width=634 alt="The final videos posted to Brittany Sauer’s TikTok page make for upsetting viewing.

However, Dr Larmie does concede that 'people who are fat are more likely to have certain conditions', although he says the evidence does not prove excess fat is the cause.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He explains: 'What is more important in driving illness is chronic stress, the impact of repeated dieting, and weight stigma and discrimination which means fat people receive far poorer care.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'The deaths of all of these people is heartbreaking and tragic. Some are deeply sad and involve binge eating disorders, which shouldn't be confused with fat acceptance. But they in no way prove that you can't be obese and healthy.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Dr Larmie's approach is not to mention weight or diets at all, and instead find out what might improve an individual's overall wellbeing.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I find what activity makes them happy and ask them to incorporate more of it in their daily lives, whether that's walking on the beach, gardening or cleaning the house. If they enjoy it, it's sustainable and will keep them moving in the longer term. I'll look at someone's daily diet and work out ways of eating better, but without restrictions.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'The result means people are happier and at a stable weight that's right for their bodies – they might, in some cases, lose weight. Just releasing people from that cycle of stress and anxiety over their weight can make them healthier overall.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>At one point, some MPs on the Women and Equalities Committee called for medics to adopt the HAES approach to avoid people being 'shamed' for their BMI.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But is it all starting to crumble? The organisation HAES UK appears to have been disbanded, and individuals have posted on social media about rejecting the movement as a result of the spate of deaths.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>One wrote that 'body positivity kept me fat and complacent' and 'enabled me to not make good decisions'. Another added: 'I feel guilty for being a part of this movement. Health is real, organs failing is real, diabetes is real. It's not fat-phobic to care about your health.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Luci Daniels, former chairman of the British Dietetic Association, the professional association for UK dieticians, says: 'HAES and fat acceptance started off with the best of intentions, but it has gone too far. Most people with excess weight would be healthier with less of it. We've been persuaded to accept that big is OK and people who are obese must learn to love themselves. But I've never met an obese person who didn't want to be a more regular size.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She concludes: 'If you are overweight, don't give up on healthy eating and healthier lifestyle choices.
