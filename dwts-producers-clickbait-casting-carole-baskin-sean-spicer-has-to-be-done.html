But the hope is that all of us are great storytellers. And at the end of the day, we're all telling really great stories in all different ways on this panel."</p><p>Speaking with <a href=#><strong>Variety</strong></a>, Katz admitted that "the country is divided, so half of the people may have one political view and the other half have the other. At the core of it, we always just go for nice, good people." Polarizing choices like Spicer, though, may lead to half the country disagreeing with that last sentiment.</p><p>You can count former host Tom Bergeron among those who clearly didn't like the idea of Spicer being on the show as he spoke publicly out against that kind of stunt casting.</p><p>While Bergeron suggested he pushed against any polarizing casting in a post to <a href=#><strong>then-Twitter</strong></a> in 2019, he also acknowledged producers have the power to make "make whatever decisions they feel are in the best long-term interests of the franchise." He added, "We can agree to disagree, as we do now, but ultimately it's their call."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:42133a36-3ec2-4570-8bfc-5456672a4086 data-container-ref=toofab:article:40fdc0d7-ebc7-4e96-bb2e-34e053376e56 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/c8/5by4/2023/12/13/c8f806675a5a42559a44dc0fbb155718_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Samantha Harris Reveals Truth Behind DWTS Exit, Unexpected 'Note' She Got About Her Body</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Katz told reporters at the TCA on Saturday that the goal was for people to be able to overcome their perceptions and give people a chance. "My hope is that someone that maybe didn't like Sean Spicer because of his political affiliation, you're watching the show, and he's just a guy," she said.</p><p>"I think what we try and do is [show] it's more than that, that you get to know these people and you end up understanding that there are people you really like," she added.</p><p>At the same time, the show has strayed from political figures after the outsized response to Spicer's short-lived run on the show, with fellow executive producer Conrad Green telling Variety that "people are exhausted by politics."</p><p>This past season saw the show come under fire for the casting of Adrian Peterson, who was indicted in 2014 on a felony charge -- but pleaded no contest to a reduced charge of misdemeanor reckless assault -- for using a switch to discipline his four-year-old son, leaving the boy with cuts all over his body.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:c9b3b65f-1bfe-4147-bacf-5c93c45951b6 data-container-ref=toofab:article:40fdc0d7-ebc7-4e96-bb2e-34e053376e56 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/a1/5by4/2021/10/12/a16c9d7fa509484caac4e001c67a6002_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Why Tom Bergeron Wasn't Surprised He Was Fired From DWTS After 28 Seasons</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"We vetted Adrian, we met Adrian. We found out everything we needed to know. He went back to play in the NFL, everybody had checked out Adrian," Katz told Variety. "We took that as we did our due diligence. We thought he was a lovely family man, his wife is great and he was an amazing football player that had an amazing record."</p><p>Green added that "a lot of people make mistakes in their lives," saying that the show's producers tried to "take a broader picture of where they're at, where they are now."</p><p>The EP also said that producers intentionally cast lesser-known people like this past season's social media star <a href=#><strong>Harry Jowsey</strong></a> -- who found controversy because he kept outlasting much better dancers on the show -- because they want to introduce people to other types of celebrities than they may be familiar with.</p><p>"Our hope is you start watching the show because of some people, but you end up staying in the show because you fall in love with others," she explained.</p><a id=gallery-link-5cee2fe2-5615-4754-b86f-f296321d708d class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:5cee2fe2-5615-4754-b86f-f296321d708d data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:40fdc0d7-ebc7-4e96-bb2e-34e053376e56 data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/56/4by3/2024/02/11/564c0b0f5534442db595285e636b2401_md.png width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3V7j2tmamlfmcS1v4ypqaicpZiys7%2BMnKOim5uXrqrAjJyYrKyZo7Rur8CrpqWdXZeutLfIp2SsnZGjerS8yJycq2WYlsBuwM5mmZ5llKS7pns%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./iggy-azalea-releases-raunchy-sex-tape-joining-onlyfans-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Iggy Azalea releases raunchy sex tape after joining OnlyFans</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./nad-supplements.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>can they really turn back the clock?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./20-year-sentence-2003-murder-ephrata-html.html>20-year sentence for 2003 murder in Ephrata</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./3-ways-can-remove-unwanted-blog-pages-google.html>3 Ways You Can Remove Unwanted Blog Pages From Google</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./5-rewarding-benefits-of-playing-the-violin.html>5 Rewarding Benefits of Playing the Violin</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./article-fbcffa51-ae5b-5b24-ba42-7821fc682093-html.html>Child molesters are the sweetest people | Columnists</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./woman-quells-racist-row-getting-boobs-train-html.html>Woman quells racist row by getting her boobs out on train</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaX.
