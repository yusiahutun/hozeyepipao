But now that a few are getting better, we wanted to give credit where credit is due--so consider this an ongoing list of sites that have made things right.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's What Happens When You Install the Top 10 Download.com Apps</a></span></p><h2 id=sourceforge-s-new-owners-cleaned-it-up>SourceForge's New Owners Cleaned It Up</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/img_572d35537e4f7.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At the end of January 2016, <a href=#>SourceForge</a> was sold to a company named BIZX, LLC. The new owners immediately <a href=#>began cleaning up SourceForge</a>, terminating the controversial "DevShare" program that wrapped open-source installers in junkware, sometimes against the&nbsp;wishes of their developers. "We want to restore our reputation as a trusted home for open source software, and this was a clear first step towards that. We’re more interested in doing the right thing than making extra short-term profit," they wrote in their announcement.</p><p>SourceForge appears to be a trustworthy place to download&nbsp;open-source software from once again.</p><p>The second most important problem--misleading "Download" buttons that push you to third-party websites offering open-source project installers wrapped in junkware--also appears to have improved. We haven't seen&nbsp;any of those ads on the new SourceForge.</p><h2 id=tucows-saw-the-light>Tucows Saw the Light</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/img_572d34e1b0813.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Tucows</a> is another old freeware download site that succumbed to the temptation of packing its installers with junkware. Back when we examined a variety of download sites, we called the Tucows software download site "an abomination [that]&nbsp;should be removed from the Internet" and found that it was probably worse than even Download.com.</p><p>On May 3, 2016, <a href=#>Tucows announced</a>&nbsp;that it, too, was done with that practice. Tucows isn't just a software download site--the company also makes money from selling domain names, cell phone service, and fiber Internet.</p><p>"For a while, we were struggling to walk away from the revenue," Tucows' Michael Goldstein told us. "But we've been growing like crazy the last couple of years (from wonderful customer-focused, subscription services) and we realized it's no longer worth the money to be associated with that nonsense. We considered just shutting the download site off but decided it felt more right to keep it running (with just a fraction of people's time here) as a sort of public service."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>So there you have it: Tucows doesn't offer the junk anymore. There's just a small bit of advertising for other Tucows services, like domain registration.</p><h2 id=download-com-abandons-its-installer>Download.com&nbsp;Abandons&nbsp;Its Installer</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/img_579914f355e33.png><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Download.com Has Finally Stopped Bundling Crapware</a></span></p><p>Download.com finally <a href=#>ended its "CNET Installer" program</a> sometime in early 2016, although it did this without any public announcement. You can now visit Download.com and you'll get direct links to download programs without any additional junkware.</p><p>This website still has a little ways to go, however. We'd like to see them clean up their advertising and getting rid of ads with misleading green&nbsp;"Download" buttons that encourage visitors to click the wrong thing. But Download.com deserves credit for abandoning&nbsp;its&nbsp;much-hated installer.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=fosshub-and-ninite-remain-excellent>FossHub and Ninite Remain Excellent</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/img_572d3575188e6.png><p>While we're at it, we&nbsp;should highlight a few high-quality&nbsp;freeware download sites that never sold out their users, too.</p><p><a href=#>FossHub</a> is an excellent download site that many projects switched to when they were abandoning SourceForge. It's a download hosting site for free and open-source software (or&nbsp;"FOSS"). FossHub has&nbsp;never bundled any junkware with its downloads. Download pages just have a single unobtrusive advertisement to help pay the bills--that's it. FossHub remains trustworthy site.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Spread the Word: Ninite is the Only Safe Place to Get Windows Freeware</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Ninite</a> is also great. For awhile, it was <a href=#>the best centralized place to get Windows freeware safely</a>, and nothing's changed there. Among the big general freeware download sites, Ninite was&nbsp;the only one that won't try to force junk onto your computer--after all, FossHub is just for open-source software.</p><p>Ninite offers&nbsp;an especially useful tool to quickly download and install software on a new PC, and it has never bundled junkware. Ninite even lets you install software that normally includes&nbsp;its own, developer-added&nbsp;junkware and skips it for you. For example, you can use Ninite to install Java without it offering&nbsp;<a href=#>Java's usual installer junkware</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/img_572d38c90a248.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>These aren't the only&nbsp;places you can download software safely, of course. Many software projects offer downloads on their own websites and these downloads can be clean, although many software projects make money by adding junkware to their own downloads.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>PUPs Explained: What is a "Potentially Unwanted Program"?</a></span></p><p><a href=#>GitHub</a> is generally fine--for open-source projects hosted on GitHub, you can download the latest software builds without any junkware. But&nbsp;GitHub is more about code hosting, and the download experience for users who aren't&nbsp;developers isn't as user-friendly.</p><p>For big freeware download sites, FossHub, Ninite, SourceForge, and Tucows seem to be the ones that aren't out to get you. We'd love&nbsp;to see more download sites follow SourceForge and Tucows, but they'll need business models that allow them to make money without "<a href=#>potentially unwanted programs</a>."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This list may look small now, but hopefully this trend continues, and more sites start cleaning up their acts and doing what's best for their users. Our goal is to keep this list up to date, so if and when more sites cut the crap(ware), we'll add them to this post. So stay tuned.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvWraagnZWge6S7zGhpbmxgaX9wwMeeZJ%2BqlZrEor7EZpuor56hvKKwjKygrZ2jYsGprdNmm6impGKzsL7CnmScqpGlxKK%2BxGamp2WppMJw</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./9-unbelievable-facts-about-lake-eibsee.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>9 Unbelievable Facts About Lake Eibsee</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./neringa-kriziutes-wiki-net-worth-husband-family-background-hot-photos-measurement-and-more.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Neringa Kriziutes Wiki, Net Worth, Husband, Family Background, Hot Photos, Measurement, And More.</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./20-year-sentence-2003-murder-ephrata-html.html>20-year sentence for 2003 murder in Ephrata</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./3-ways-can-remove-unwanted-blog-pages-google.html>3 Ways You Can Remove Unwanted Blog Pages From Google</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./5-rewarding-benefits-of-playing-the-violin.html>5 Rewarding Benefits of Playing the Violin</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./article-fbcffa51-ae5b-5b24-ba42-7821fc682093-html.html>Child molesters are the sweetest people | Columnists</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./woman-quells-racist-row-getting-boobs-train-html.html>Woman quells racist row by getting her boobs out on train</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaX.
