On Friday it released the iPad mini – a scaled-down version of its beloved tablet computer – but it failed to generate the same excitement as previous launches.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Apple’s late co-founder Steve Jobs had once derided the whole concept of small tablets, saying they should be packaged with sandpaper, “so that the user can sand down their fingers to around one quarter of the present size”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In a reversal, the iPad mini saw Apple following Samsung into a segment the South Korean firm had already entered earlier this year with the 7-inch version of its Galaxy Tab 2.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But in general, Apple has been the pioneer and Samsung has played catch-up. Nevertheless, Samsung has shown itself to be unbeatable when it comes to gathering its vast resources behind a full-frontal assault on new markets.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The copycat label still sticks to Samsung whether it likes it or not, but there’s still a great business in that,” said senior IDC research analyst Kevin Restivo.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Being a fast follower can be a path to number one, and Samsung is a case study for that,” Restivo said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Most analysts point to two key factors behind Samsung’s success in the hugely competitive smartphone market – its embrace of Google’s Android operating system and its low- to high-end marketing strategy.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">By adopting the popular Android platform and concentrating solely on hardware, Samsung was able to leapfrog smartphone makers such as Nokia and Blackberry-maker RIM who stuck with their own operating systems.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Once it commandeered the Android battleship and got it pointed in the right direction, it made real dents in the opposition,” Restivo said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Its marketing strategy, meanwhile, has been to put up a high-end flagship model – the Samsung Galaxy S series – to challenge the iPhone while pumping out other more affordable models, especially in markets like Brazil and China.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The Galaxy S series is really just the tip of the iceberg for Samsung, which makes a huge number of lesser-known, lower-priced smartphones,” said Greg Roh, an analyst at HMC Investment Security.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Globally, there are not a whole lot of consumers who can actually afford iPhones, so Samsung is catering to a far wider range of consumers than Apple and has the market share to prove it,” Roh said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Samsung deploys a shotgun strategy, scattering the market with new phones being released – or older ones being refreshed – every six to nine months to continually push up its unit volume.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Apple, meanwhile, has stuck to rolling out one high-end smartphone device a year with a far higher profit margin than Samsung’s product range.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Although the South Korean firm has gobbled up market share, Apple still leads its rival in terms of overall profitability in the smartphone sector.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Looking forward, James Song, a technology analyst at Daewoo Securities, believes it is the California-based company that will have to change course.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I think Apple will soon be forced to roll out mid- or low-priced gadgets in order to survive,” Song said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The current market landscape is that Apple has a market share of, say, 20 per cent with a [profit] margin of 40 per cent, whereas Samsung has a market share of 40 per cent with a margin of 20 per cent.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Which one will survive in the end? Definitely the latter,” he said, noting that Apple component suppliers were already demanding higher prices that would impact profit margins.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Underscoring its commitment to variety, Samsung announced on Friday that global sales of its scaled-up smartphone, the Galaxy Note II, had topped three million since its debut in late September.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The main issue for Samsung, according to both Song and Restivo, is how it handles its future relations with Google, given its dependency on the Android platform.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Google’s recent acquisition of smartphone maker Motorola Mobility was seen by many as the start of a trend that would see power in the smartphone market shift from hardware to software companies.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Samsung’s strength is still largely confined to hardware, and it really needs to develop its software capability given Apple and Google’s control in that area,” Song said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kr7a%2FyKecrKtfmLyuvMCnoJ6rX5a%2FtbXCpZxoaWBsgnF9l2iYqaicmsBur86oo2aulafAtr%2BMrJimq6WjtG651KyapZ0%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ellie-gouldings-net-worth-updated-2023.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Ellie Goulding's Net Worth (Updated 2023)</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./362997-a-dolls-house-analysis-themes-characters-short-summary-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>A Doll's House analysis: themes, characters and short summary</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./20-year-sentence-2003-murder-ephrata-html.html>20-year sentence for 2003 murder in Ephrata</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./3-ways-can-remove-unwanted-blog-pages-google.html>3 Ways You Can Remove Unwanted Blog Pages From Google</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./5-rewarding-benefits-of-playing-the-violin.html>5 Rewarding Benefits of Playing the Violin</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./article-fbcffa51-ae5b-5b24-ba42-7821fc682093-html.html>Child molesters are the sweetest people | Columnists</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./woman-quells-racist-row-getting-boobs-train-html.html>Woman quells racist row by getting her boobs out on train</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaX.
