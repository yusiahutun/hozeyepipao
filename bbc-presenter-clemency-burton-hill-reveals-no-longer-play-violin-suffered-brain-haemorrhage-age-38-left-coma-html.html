[All music] shouldn't have boundaries or barriers to entry, but particularly classical music [shouldn't].'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Clemency continued: 'It often makes people feel shut out.

All through my life, but also many other interests in very many different pursuits. And I always felt this is so wrong, that there's a kind of fake barrier like if...you don't know the lingo, or you don't know what something means, you shouldn't be in the space of classical music and that I found incredibly distressing and also really, absolutely not true.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>It was largely this sense of distress that led to Clemency wanting to make music accessible to as many people as possible, via her series of books, which makes recommendations for people, helping them navigate the often overwhelming world of classical music.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Speaking about how listening to music has helped her, she explained: 'In the beginning, after my brain ruptured, it was so discombobulating - obviously everything was - but not being able to feel or hear music as I used to do [especially].</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'And obviously I can't use my right side really at all. So unfortunately, I'm not able to play the violin again. I can't do many, many of the things that I really relied on in my former life.

So that's a wonderful thing.'&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Clemency Burton-Hill has written before about how badly she was affected by the stroke, and how lucky she feels to have survived the way she has.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Writing in 2020, she said: 'I'm aware that I’ve been so, so lucky. The AVM is still there – Dr Kellner and his team are treating it with radiotherapy – and there is a long road ahead.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'But it is a salutary reminder to live every day to its fullest. Life is a miracle. I am so grateful that, because of the exceptional medical care I was privileged to have access to, I survived. '</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>And now, she has used that perspective to help others appreciate classical music, through her award-winning writing.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaJ6Voq6quI6aqa2hk6Gybn2Rcmdyb2FofIOOomanq52jmru1sdFmeqWdnZq7pMWMe6yrrJ%2Bjeom1y6Vkq52mmq6tv4ynpmakn6O0pr6MqaOasV2rtrC4yKdkrK2Wm7KzscNmmauZmaN6qa3EpqarqpiWtKZ5wKCcZmtoYrmmstNmmqilkWO1tbnL</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./gillian-anderson-joins-star-jason-isaacs-set-salt-path-cornwall-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Gillian Anderson joins co-starJason Isaacs on the set of The Salt Path in Cornwall</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./best-pink-coats-for-women.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>8 best pink coats for women 2023: Longline to puffer coats, teddy fleece coats &amp;amp; more</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./20-year-sentence-2003-murder-ephrata-html.html>20-year sentence for 2003 murder in Ephrata</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./3-ways-can-remove-unwanted-blog-pages-google.html>3 Ways You Can Remove Unwanted Blog Pages From Google</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./5-rewarding-benefits-of-playing-the-violin.html>5 Rewarding Benefits of Playing the Violin</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./article-fbcffa51-ae5b-5b24-ba42-7821fc682093-html.html>Child molesters are the sweetest people | Columnists</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./woman-quells-racist-row-getting-boobs-train-html.html>Woman quells racist row by getting her boobs out on train</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaX.
