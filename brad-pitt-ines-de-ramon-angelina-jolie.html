Jolie’s lawyers further claimed Pitt refused the deal unless it came with the NDA and suggest the actor feared that sealed documents included in their separate, years-long custody battle could be made public without the NDA.</p><p>“Jolie’s sealed filing, which included emails, summaries of the family’s expected testimony and other evidence, caused Pitt to fear that the information could eventually become public,” her lawyers write in court documents <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://people.com/angelina-jolie-lawyers-claim-brad-pitt-abuse-started-before-2016-plane-incident-8624974 rel=nofollow>obtained by People</a>.
