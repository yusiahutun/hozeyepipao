Leung and his sister worked as cooks in a congee and wonton noodle shop in Chinatown while his younger brother washed dishes and his mother babysat.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">After two years, Leung recalls, a friend took his family to a tourist attraction called Granville Island, where they saw vendors doing brisk business selling fresh fruit and vegetables on tables they rented out daily.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“New immigrants wanted to get into business, but how?” says Leung of that time. The family decided to give it a try, despite knowing nothing about retail, let alone the fresh-produce business. Back in Guangzhou, Leung’s parents had worked in a state-owned bus company, his father in human resources, his mother in bookkeeping.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/10/05/ec879248-9349-43e9-b7c6-55446a2b70ad_337a23b6.jpg>Leung had just obtained his driving licence, so in the mornings they drove to farms to buy produce and sold it in Granville Island. In the afternoons, he attended a government-sponsored English class, followed by evening shifts in the <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">wonton noodle</span></a> shop.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We only knew about gai lan and bak choi, we didn’t know what raspberries and strawberries were,” he says. But when they saw people buying these berries, the family found farmers to source them from, along with other popular produce such as lettuce.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">People liked buying their produce because it was fresh, but business slowed down significantly during the winter. Granville Island is located right by the water, and when business was slow, Leung would set crab traps, reasoning that if they didn’t sell much produce, at least his family could eat crab.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/10/05/13f1c859-9461-4c34-84a6-60d14d4ad83b_b1d492cc.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">However, they could not watch both the traps and the stall at the same time, and the traps were stolen. Adding to their dismay, they discovered that other stalls were making 10 times more daily revenue than they did.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Leungs realised they had to step up their customer service and use their broken English to persuade people to buy from them.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We introduced the produce to them, told them how to prepare it, or gave fruits to the children and chatted with their parents,” says Leung.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">They called it ‘Humiliation Day’: the Canadian law that split Chinese families</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Leung’s wife, Queenie Chu, adds: “At the time paper bags were expensive and we got a lot of plastic bags for free, so we helped people bag their other purchases as an extra service.” Chu started working as a cashier at Kin’s in 1987 and the couple were married six years later.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It was this philosophy of treating customers like friends that helped the family build its business to the point where they could open their first bricks-and-mortar shop, in Richmond in 1987.</p>“At the time many Westerners didn’t know what a <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">papaya</span></a> was and I told them eating it was better than skincare,” says Leung with a smile. “My father liked to help customers choose watermelons.”<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/10/05/0143563d-1102-423d-bdd6-451c35e152cf_2a48f19f.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Each farm’s growing season is different, but usually the beginning and end of the season don’t have the best produce,” he says. “It’s the period in the middle when the produce is the best, so I only buy it then. That’s why I go to different farms to source the same produce because I need to give the best to customers.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In 1990, the family opened their second store, in Ladner, which was double the size of the Richmond shop. Following customers’ suggestions, the Leungs tried selling dry goods, such as sauces and newspapers. But after a few months it became clear that no one was buying these items and they were just taking up space. The Leungs decided to once again focus on their strength – fresh produce.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/10/05/a94c7aff-f033-4042-9e5c-4a76b5d5eb40_4c3bc3f2.jpg><a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">During the 1990s</span></a>, when a new wave of Hong Kong immigrants arrived and suggested Kin’s add more Asian vegetables to their stock and Chinese characters to their pricing signs, Leung refused.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We welcome all people to come here to shop,” he says. “We have done so well with the local Canadian population and they have accepted us. We can open shops anywhere.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">They saw their limitations in 2007, however, when they expanded on the east coast with two stores in Ontario, an hour’s drive from Toronto. Finding it difficult to manage the businesses from afar, they closed them after about three years.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/10/05/b2890208-e0f2-4b42-a2d9-b87050eda6e1_609f2994.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Leung’s stepson, Victor Lau, is the chief operating officer and third generation of Kin’s Farm Market. In high school, Lau started stocking produce and learning bookkeeping. After graduating from university with a business degree, he worked in merchandising and now focuses on buying, distribution and marketing.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">During a tour of their warehouse, we spot supersized button mushrooms, bright-red hothouse tomatoes, deep purple plums, sweet-smelling peaches and several varieties of grapes including the coronation, which starts sweet and has a slightly tart finish.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Kin’s buys as much produce locally as possible, but in the off-season they source from 45 countries, including the United States, Mexico and as far away as Israel, Japan and the Netherlands.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Today, Kin’s Farm Market has 23 stores and Leung says they are keen to expand further.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I believe every neighbourhood needs fresh fruits and vegetables,” he says, explaining the manifesto that supports their motto: “To inspire a better quality of life in our communities.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuqKzwLOgp52jZL2wv9NmpJqfka%2B2r7GOn6aonF2Zv6q6ymiYq6yZmLmme5Jram9wZ2h8r7uMpqannaliu7B5xKeepaGjnXqktMinnKydXZuurrXLsmScmZ6WsaJ50aiqnmWSpMG1u8xmmKecXaO8uHnOsKVmnqKqtrV5wKebZq6VnHqmuc%2BiqZ4%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./vivid-seats-buys-toronto-based-ticketing-company-for-up-to-60-million.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Vivid Seats Buys Toronto-Based Ticketing Company For Up To $60 Million</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./meaning-of-man-in-the-mirror-2023-by-michael-jackson.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Meaning of Man In The Mirror 2023 by Michael Jackson</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./20-year-sentence-2003-murder-ephrata-html.html>20-year sentence for 2003 murder in Ephrata</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./3-ways-can-remove-unwanted-blog-pages-google.html>3 Ways You Can Remove Unwanted Blog Pages From Google</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./5-rewarding-benefits-of-playing-the-violin.html>5 Rewarding Benefits of Playing the Violin</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./article-fbcffa51-ae5b-5b24-ba42-7821fc682093-html.html>Child molesters are the sweetest people | Columnists</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./woman-quells-racist-row-getting-boobs-train-html.html>Woman quells racist row by getting her boobs out on train</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaX.
