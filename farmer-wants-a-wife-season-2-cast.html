This will give the ladies a full taste of what it takes to be a farmer's wife.</p><h3>Meet the Farmers on Season 2 of Farmer Wants a Wife:</h3><figure class="img-tag has-sizer aligncenter"><p><span class=visually-hidden>YouTube</span></p>YouTube<p>loading...</p></figure><p><strong>Ty Ferrell, 42</strong>&nbsp;— prefers to call himself a cowboy instead of a farmer, because his job description is "team roper". He maintains a 50-acre farm in Sikeston, Mo., with horses and cattle. Roping and riding is in his blood, as he's been doing it since he was a child. Ferrell, one of the older farmers seen on the show, is a divorced father of a 12-year-old daughter.&nbsp; He's looking for someone to not only be his mate, but a good mother to his child.</p><figure class="img-tag has-sizer aligncenter"><p><span class=visually-hidden>YouTube</span></p>YouTube<p>loading...</p></figure><p><strong>Mitchell Kolinsky, 27</strong>&nbsp;— a first generation farmer in Mount Juliet, Tenn. His sprawling property features lots of wildlife and a 19th century cabin, where he lives with his three dogs. Kolinsky grew up with horses and spent a lot of time outdoors, which prompted him to begin a career in farming. He now owns his own farm with horses and cattle.</p><figure class="img-tag has-sizer aligncenter"><p><span class=visually-hidden>YouTube</span></p>YouTube<p>loading...</p></figure><p><strong>Brandon Rogers, 29</strong>&nbsp;— operates a 1,000-acre potato and barley farm in Center, Colo. The town he lives in is quite small — it has only one stoplight — and is surrounded by farmland. He's a second generation farmer and spent his childhood working the farm with his father. Rogers continues to work the family business and hopes to continue the legacy started by his dad.</p><figure class="img-tag has-sizer aligncenter"><p><span class=visually-hidden>YouTube</span></p>YouTube<p>loading...</p></figure><p><strong>Nathan Smothers, 23</strong>&nbsp;— has farming in his blood. He's a fourth generation citrus and cattle farmer in Bartow, Fla. His&nbsp;massive property&nbsp;features 300 acres of farmland and over 500 acres of land dedicated to the cattle. Smothers is the youngest farmer featured on the show, but he's wise beyond his years. After losing his father at the age of 12, he has had to step up and help take care of his mom and three sisters.</p><p>Farmer Wants a Wife&nbsp;Season 2 premieres on Thursday, Feb. 1, at 9PM ET on Fox.</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>50 Best Country Love Songs</h2><p>Check out country music's 50 best love songs, from the legends like Glen Campbell and Conway Twitty to new country crooners like Blae Shelton and Shania Twain.
