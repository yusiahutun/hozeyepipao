I’ve known him for so long, and I know that he’s had very personal family connections to OxyContin,” Berg told TV Insider.</p><p>“He had a sister that struggled with a very serious OxyContin addiction, and he took time out from his career to help her. She’s good now, but I know how rough it was for Taylor and his family to go through an opioid addiction that intensely.”</p><p>Berg continued, “…I immediately thought about him because I knew he was right for the role to play someone like Glen, a small business owner gets hurt on a job — that seems right in Taylor’s wheelhouse.
