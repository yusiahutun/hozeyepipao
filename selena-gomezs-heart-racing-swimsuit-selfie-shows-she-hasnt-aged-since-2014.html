Especially, for the second, as she posed in a tight black swimsuit.</p><p>The Disney Channel alum took to her bathroom mirror to post a black one-piece swimsuit with her hair scraped back in a bun.</p><p>In the selfie, Selena turned her head to the side, as her curves were on show in the plunging one-piece. Her scar from her <a href=#>kidney transplant surgery</a> was also on show.</p><p>Of course, her bathroom was full of her own Rare Beauty products which were on full display.</p><p>Upon seeing the ‘stunning’ photo, fans took to social media to share their thoughts, with some even joking her ex Justin Bieber would “love” the post.</p><p>“Justin Bieber will wow after seeing this,” joked one.</p><p>“Selena Gomez is always stunning,” wrote another.</p><p>Another exclaimed: “Omg she ATE!”</p><p>One Selena fan went as far as to say: “I am so obsessed with this photo.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-fans-say-selena-hasn-t-aged-since-2014>Fans say Selena ‘hasn’t aged since 2014’</h2><p>Just a few hours before, the actress posted another mirror selfie, this time with her legs exposed as she wore a chic leather jacket. She stared down at her phone while she posed in the mirror, showing off her neon pink nails, however, fans were more focused on how young she looked.</p><p>As they couldn’t comment directly on the pictures from her story, they took to X, formerly known as <a href=#>Twitter</a> to comment on her recent posts as they say the 31-year-old is “aging like fine wine.”</p><p>One fan even took to the platform to post a side-by-side picture of the star in 2014. At the time, Gomez would have been just 22 years old, however, both photos easily look like they could have been taken on the same night, and social media users agreed.</p><p>“She hasn’t aged a day,” penned one.</p><p>“Omg wow she looks amazing,” wrote another.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmlxX2Z%2FcL%2FEpZynmV2cvK6x2axkoZ2Rp8FuvsCcoKefXajEqrnSrqCtZaOauae1xGaqoaenqHq0tMRmn5qrnql6orPEnWSsoZ6Ysm5%2Bj2praA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jake-logan-paul-boxing-wrestling-26034775.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Women's world wrestling champion calls out Logan Paul and brother Jake Paul</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./is-mean-girls-netflix-how-to-watch-totally-fetch-comedy-on-oct-3-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Is 'Mean Girls' on Netflix?
