href=# data-link-name="in body link" data-component=auto-linked-tag>Paul Newman</a>, who appeared in his first film more than half a century ago, flooded in over the weekend, praising his dedication to fundraising for charity, the civil rights movement and motor sports.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>The death of the 83-year-old actor at his 18th-century farmhouse in Connecticut after a protracted battle against cancer severed one of the few remaining links with the legendary era of black and white cinema.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>His lack of conceit and reluctance to exploit his fame for personal gain earned him the appreciation of fellow professionals, film critics and politicians on both sides of the Atlantic.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>Robert Redford, his veteran fellow star, said at the weekend: "There is a point where feelings go beyond words. I have lost a real friend. My life - and this country - is better for his being in it."</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>Sir Michael Parkinson, who interviewed Newman for a documentary, said he was "one of the very finest screen actors" of our time. "[Newman] spanned the gap between the golden days of Hollywood, the 40s and 50s with actors like Cary Grant and James Stewart and Clark Gable, and the present lot represented by Brad Pitt, Tom Cruise," he said.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>Parkinson described Newman as "quiet, reserved and suspicious": he had been deeply affected by the death of his only son, Scott, from a drug overdose in 1978.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>Sam Mendes, who directed Newman in the 2002 film Road to Perdition, remembered it as "the highlight of my professional life".</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>Mendes said: "It seems to me to be one of the great 20th-century lives: he was famously generous, with his extraordinary and unstinting work for his charities, he was a passionate advocate for the adrenaline and danger of his beloved racing cars, he was a shining example of how to use global fame for the greater good, and most of all he was one of the great movie actors of this or any other age."</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>As well as establishing a foundation to finance anti-drug films in memory of his son, Newman set up summer camps for terminally ill children paid for by sales of personally endorsed food products.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>He was nominated 10 times for an Oscar, winning best actor in 1987 for The Colour Of Money. He received an honorary Oscar in 1986 and won a third in 1994, the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award, for his charitable work.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>His best known roles included playing alongside Robert Redford in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969) and The Sting (1973). He starred with his second wife, Joanne Woodward, in several films including Long Hot Summer and Paris Blues; they had been married for 50 years.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>During the 1960s and 70s, Newman supported civil rights protests and went on anti-Vietnam war demonstrations.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>In later life his enthusiasm for racing came to the fore. As a driver, Newman's career highlight was his second place finish in the Le Mans 24 Hours race of 1979.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>As team owner of Newman/Haas, his squad claimed eight Indy/Champ Car titles. Former formula one world champions Nigel Mansell and Mario Andretti were among the drivers.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>Ron Dennis, formula one's McLaren chief, said: "[Newman] was a fine driver, who was famous in Hollywood for doing his own stunt driving as often as not."</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>Nicolas Sarkozy, the French president, even hailed him as "a great friend of France ... the fans of motor racing will remember his successive appearances at the Le Mans 24 Hours race".</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>Arnold Schwarzenegger, governor of California, said: "[Newman] entertained millions in some of Hollywood's most memorable roles ever, and brightened the lives of many more, especially seriously ill children, through his charitable works."</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>In a joint statement, Newman's five daughters from his two marriages said: "Our father was a rare symbol of selfless humility, the last to acknowledge what he was doing was special."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoKyaqpSerq96wqikaJ6Zobpwfo9pb2irlaV8c4WOqZiupJ6axK6tzWesrJlh</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./restaurateur-mark-cholewkas-favourite-hong-kong-places-eat.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Restaurateur Mark Cholewkas favourite Hong Kong places to eat - with the accent on local and regi</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./tamaris-sepulveda-bio-age-job-ethnicity-fboy-island.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Meet FBoy Island Tamaris Sepulveda!
