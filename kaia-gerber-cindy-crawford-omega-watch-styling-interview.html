Last night, sitting in front of Cindy Crawford and Kaia Gerber at the Planet Omega exhibition in New York, I watched Gerber glance down at her <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.omegawatches.com/en-us/watch-omega-de-ville-mini-tresor-quartz-26-mm-42855266099001 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Omega Mini Trésor" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Omega Mini Trésor</a> watch looking anything but. Shortly after, she told me, “Women weren't always allowed to wear watches—but some of the first watches that were made for women were made by Omega!”</p><p>The mother-daughter duo, representing two generations of Omega ambassadors, were set to talk on a panel at the Chelsea Factory exhibition, which traces Omega’s history—like being the first (and only!) watch to ever make it to the moon or the Mariana Trench. It hadn't even started yet, and already Gerber was casually schooling me.</p><img alt=omega title=omega width=2880 height=3600 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/planet-omega-kaia-gerber-cindy-crawford-65551106648d1.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">OMEGA</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She was right. Omega was one of the first brands to make wristwatches for women, and to do it with pride. Other watchmakers might have hidden their women's timepieces with clasps that made them look like jewelry, but Omega just produced smaller versions of its diamond-studded men’s watches. Now, decades later, the bands has found a home on supermodels' wrists everywhere.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“I've worked with Omega for almost 30 years,” Crawford said. “And I think Omega really understands that the way women wear watches is different from the way in which men wear watches. For women, it's jewelry! And for men, it's more about status. I wear a watch every day, even though I never look at it for time, layered with other chain bracelets…it's a way to accessorize that feels super easy.”<br></p><img alt="a person in a dress" title="a person in a dress" width=1680 height=2100 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/planet-omega-cindy-crawford-6555111c4bda0.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">OMEGA</span></p><p>Gerber, who is 22, chimed in, “I have never lived at a time when a watch was a necessity, so I think I have a very different relationship to them. For me, they feel super timeless and classic, in the way that people don't read physical copies of books or listen to records on record players. There's something really special about the sentiment of a watch, especially now because you don't really need them anymore.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Wearing a luxury watch in 2023 is a choice, one that has, surprisingly, become popular with Gerber’s generation. Gen Z has always carried information about the world in the palm of their hands, but they still seem eager to wear the time on their wrists.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“It's the same thing as when you see people walking around with Walkmans,” Gerber said. “People are just very into vintage things right now. As our world moves forward and more towards digital, I think people tend to crave these vintage things. That's what it is. It's why you see people with the headphones with the wires even though there are AirPods!”</p><img alt="a woman posing for a picture" title="a woman posing for a picture" width=1680 height=2100 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/planet-omega-kaia-gerber-6555118ddfb08.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">OMEGA</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“I love my wired headphones!” Crawford quipped, before adding: “I guess every generation always comes back to what the generation before did. And watches are truly sustainable in that sense because they can be passed down for generations. Sometimes you pull it out 20 or 30 years later and it's new again—even though it's actually old.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">At this point Gerber’s eyes lit up as she leaned forward, the gold band of her Mini Trésor adjusted tightly around the sleeve of her black top, to tell me, “In a world of so much unnecessary waste, buying a watch that’ll last you a lifetime is one of the most sustainable things you can do.” And just like that, she was right again.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When I left the event, I looked down at my own watch, only to remember that I need to take it in to get the time correctly set. But maybe that doesn't even matter. As Gerber and Crawford reminded me, watches are about more than the numbers the dial point to. These days, women wear watches because they can, not because they need to.<br></p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/a3e534fd-dc82-4b22-be80-50efa84b1924_1663767759.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Tara Gonzalez" title="Headshot of Tara Gonzalez" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Tara Gonzalez is the Senior Fashion Editor at Harper’s Bazaar.
