But the reality is that they all have something they would like to tell their girls but remain silent. And the fascinating part is that they have remained silent for many generations. Men have not changed for centuries, hence the reason many women think of them as complicated. It does not help to overanalyse boys. If a girl wants to know what boys want, they should look at the simple things that make men happy.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/8b6a9c4ebf2550e6.jpg><p class=align-left>Men are less complicated, unlike what most women think. What boys want are almost the same things that girls want. The difference is that many guys will not ask for what they want from their partners.</p><h2>What boys want in girls — top 15 things</h2><p class=align-left>So, what do guys want in a relationship? Here are 15 things you should know.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/c61f97f8202b1968.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Benjamin Zulu advises women not to let men pay their bills when dating</span></p></a><h3>1. Intimacy and not a fling</h3><p class=align-left>Many girls assume that boys are after them for sex. While having sex with a partner you like is one of the ultimate goals of a relationship, guys want a relationship with a girl for its connection and trust. Guys want intimacy and are not attracted to the idea of a quick romantic sexual romp.</p><p class=align-left>Although some of them only want a fling, it usually presents itself as a selfish desire to use a young woman and to satisfy their sexual desires. But many guys will not tell girls they want intimacy in a relationship. That is because society has already perceived them as people that are only after sex and nothing more.</p><h3>2. Sexual confidence</h3><p class=align-left>Sexual confidence is a topic many boys never introduce in a relationship. But the reality is that they do not like it when their female partner is shy in bed. They find unsure and nervous girls as unattractive.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/efa4f5facd63c9a9.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Dating broke men hoping they'll succeed is a waste of time, Kenyans agree</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>20 biggest pet peeves in relationships</p><p class=align-left>When a girl is nervous, her man will not think that he is the problem. Instead, he will assume that she has a problem with him. That can discourage him to the point of pushing her away. A sexually confident lady is a turn on for any man.</p><h3>3. Some downtime to relax</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/efa4f5facd63c9a9.jpeg><p class=align-left>Generally, what boys expect from girls is some downtime during the week. Many need at least an hour alone to relax at home and not get interruptions. The need for some time alone does not mean that he does not love her.</p><p class=align-left>He has been working for hours and does not want his girl to add him the stress she has been gaining from the day. Most boys will not ask for time alone for fear of not being understood. But this is what they need to get conformable and unwind.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/1ce5d7a0d3c12e76.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Wife or mother: who should come first in a man's life?</span></p></a><h3>4. A girl to make the first move</h3><p class=align-left>One of the things guys like in bed but won’t ask for is a girl to make the first move. Men get turned on whenever a girl makes the first move. It shows them that she is sexy and confident.</p><p class=align-left>While many girls try to avoid it because they think it is embarrassingly emasculating, men think of it as dating a bold woman. They also feel that they have an unintimidating partner.</p><h3>5. Compliments for the little things they do</h3><p class=align-left>Throughout a relationship, what a guy wants from a girl is a compliment. When you fail to compliment your man, it shows you are in a fake relationship. Men need their partners to praise them for simple things that look good on them.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> A prayer for someone you love to come back</p><p class=align-left>Complements will make him feel good and show that you are paying attention to some of the little things he is doing for himself or you. Expressing your esteem for his new haircut, pair of trousers, or shirt will also make him feel loved.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0fgjhs2erjrflimk4g.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>10 best dating sites for black women</span></p></a><h3>6. Support from a girl</h3><p class=align-left>One of the things guys want but won't ask for is support from their partner. Your guy wants you to support and believe in him. He wants you to trust him that he is smart and capable of succeeding not only on his own but with your input too.</p><p class=align-left>Listen to what he has to say and give him your opinions whenever he asks. Supporting him also shows you are secure with him and allows him to focus on pursuing his mission. Men feel loved whenever their woman is in their corner no matter the circumstances.</p><h3>7. Share his interests</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/304d6bcb8fe486cd.jpg><p class=align-left>Sharing his interests is one of the many things every guy wants from his girlfriend. He wants you to watch a game of football with him or play a video game. A lack of interest in what he loves makes him feel unwanted, insecure, and unappreciated.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/fa51becc7f79a536.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>10 books that make you think about love in a different way</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Even if you do not like some of the things he does, make an effort to share his interests. You do not have to play a video game with him all the time. But try to do it occasionally.</p><h3>8. He wants to know your plans</h3><p class=align-left>One of the things guys like to talk about most of the time is the future. Many boys have a mission, and they know where they are going. They will talk about their plans and how to achieve them. Also, they like to know what a girl’s plans are so that they can incorporate into theirs or determine whether they align.</p><p class=align-left>Although he will not ask you what your plans are, it will be his mission to make you part of his future. However, ensure to inform you what your future holds.</p><h3>9. He wants you to be open-minded</h3><p class=align-left>A guy wants a girl that is open-mended in all aspects, including sexually. An open-minded girl is more approachable and easy for a guy to talk to and share his thoughts, feelings, and problems. Such a lady also tends to be attractive and satisfying to the man.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/a329d0f18dc6ec02.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>10 behavioural signs of Taurus man when he likes you</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> How to pull away emotionally from a guy you love</p><p class=align-left>When both people are open-minded, it helps to strengthen a relationship and facilitate communication. That makes it easier for guys to tell their girls things they are afraid to ask.</p><h3>10. He wants you to have a sense of humour</h3><p class=align-left>A man likes it when his girl finds his sense of humour funny. He wants you to laugh at his jokes because it shows a certain level of connection between the two of you. It is also a worse feeling to be around somebody that does not laugh at the funny things you say.</p><p class=align-left>A sense of humour is a sign of a fruitful relationship. It shows both of you are getting along well. Your sense of humour makes it easier for him to do things that will make you happy.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/e974b1ad64e30313.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Why do guys stare but never approach me?</span></p></a><h3>11. He wants you to be a freak in bed</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/1ce5d7a0d3c12e76.jpg><p class=align-left>One of the things guys want in a relationship is a woman who is a freak in bed. Men find it enjoyable when their partner is adventurous when it comes to sexual intercourse. While that does not mean getting gagged with chains, they want someone that will try new things.</p><p class=align-left>Your man wants you to suggest some moves that he is thinking about but will not tell you. For example, propose for both of you to remain naked in the house for a whole weekend and have fun.</p><h3>12. He does not want you to be perfect</h3><p class=align-left>Most girls spend a lot of time trying to make themselves sexy and attractive to their men. They even go to the lengths of presenting themselves as wild, exciting, fun, and less needy. While there is nothing wrong with that, it does not work all the time.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/f39ac4e902a235e4.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>My girlfriend has a celebrity crush: Should I be worried?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Men do not want a perfect woman. They want somebody that will bring out the best in them. Trying to be too perfect will cause him anxiety. If he has an interest in you, he will love you for whom you are.</p><h3>13. He wants you to challenge him</h3><p class=align-left>Men love a challenge and like to chase. It is the reason why playing hard to get makes a girl more attractive. If you give him everything on your first date, he will think of you as cheap and take advantage of you.</p><p class=align-left>Challenge him by not revealing everything to him. Force him to chase you because it satisfies his ego and makes him understand whether he wants you.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>The major roles of a man in a relationship</p><h3>14. Men want girls to be loyal to them</h3><p class=align-left>A man will not tell you to be loyal to him. He not only wants you to be true to him, but his friends, and family too. Being disloyal even to people around him like strangers makes him think of you as insecure and less attractive.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/8b6a9c4ebf2550e6.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Girlfriend duties in a relationship: 30 things girlfriends do</span></p></a><p class=align-left>But being loyal does not mean subjecting yourself to everything he says. Show respect and give him attention is all that he needs.</p><h3>15. Boys do not like neediness</h3><p class=align-left>Boys want girls that need them. But it should not get to a point where she is too needy. Neediness will force him to back off.</p><p class=align-left>Being needy will make him lose interest fast. It also makes a girl look like a burden, something that most boys try to avoid. So, while it is satisfactory to depend on him from time to time, doing it all the time is unattractive.</p><p class=align-left>Generally, what boys want in a relationship is a partner that supports them, is less needy, and complements them from time to time. Guys also like girls who challenge them and are freaks in bed. You will improve your relationship with a man if you are open-minded, share his interests, and give him some downtime to relax.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/df8816cae26f4c2a.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Signs your girlfriend is lesbian or bisexual</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> 15 things that a lady is supposed to do in a relationship</p><p></p><strong class=article-ytsubscribe__title>Subscribe to watch new videos</strong><p>Source: TUKO.co.ke</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tcHKqGWcp16gsnB%2FlW9rbWtdrLWiwIybprKrXWaCbrPUsqpmn5mnubR51qilrWWWpL9vtNOmow%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-call-heather-gay-rhoslc.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who Called Heather Gay in RHOSLC Season 4 Premiere?
