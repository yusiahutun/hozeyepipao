However, to neutralize stubborn yellow or orange tones, you should get your hands on a highly pigmented hair mask or toning liquid to achieve the desired results.</p><p>In addition to toning pigments, look for products with nourishing ingredients coconut oil, argan oil, aloe extracts, glycerin, sweet almond oil, panthenol, etc. to boost hydration in your hair.&nbsp;</p><p>Also, always ensure that the product you’re using is free from harmful contents such as phthalates, mineral oil, formaldehyde, ammonia, hydroquinone, and toluene as they can cause hair damage and hormonal problems. While this is difficult to find in many demi-permanent hair toners, a formula free from hydrogen peroxide makes it safer for your precious tresses.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Color Intensity of Your Hair:</strong> While all blonde toners consist of cool-toned colors to neutralize the brassiness of your hair, the precise color you need varies depending on your hair color. If your natural or pre-lightened hair has a very light and pale blonde color, then a purple or silver toner would be ideal for reducing the yellow tones on it. However, if your hair is medium, dark, or dirty blonde, then a blue or silver-blue toner would be perfect to neutralize the rusty, orange tones on it. The key is in selecting a pigment that is placed opposite to your hair color on the color wheel.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Hair Type</strong>: While most toners work well on all hair types, some formulations work only for certain hair types such as low porosity, curly, etc. Hence, always check whether the product packaging explicitly mentions so.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Lasting Power:</strong> The effects of an over-the-counter color toner usually last from 4 to 8 weeks, depending on the formulation used. So, understand what kind of results you are looking for and how often you would actually be able to use the product before making a purchase.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to the above-mentioned factors, ensure that your toner does not bleed or deposit stubborn pigments on your hair.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class=title>How to Use a Toner for Blonde Hair?</h2></p><p>The methods to use a toner vary depending on the formula you use. Here are the ways to use a few common toner formulations:</p><p><strong>Creme + Developer:</strong> This is by far the most elaborate and long-lasting toner formula that needs to be applied through meticulous steps. To begin with, mix the color creme and developer in a 50:50 ratio. Then, depending on the viscosity of the toner, you can either use a dye brush to apply the product or pour the mixture directly on your hair. Ensure you wear rubber gloves when performing this task as the concentrated products can cause your fingers to stain. Cover your hair with a shower cap after application and rinse off after the instructed duration.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Hair Mask/Glaze:</strong> The second most long-lasting and concentrated formula in the list, a hair mask or glaze simply skips one step from the former method, as there is nothing to mix. And when you put on secure gloves on your hands, you don’t even have to use a dye brush to apply the product. Take a generous amount of the product in batches in your hands and apply it directly on the roots and lengths of your hair. Be careful at this step, as such products easily stain the walls and the floor. Let the product settle in your hair for 30-40 minutes or as instructed in the product manual. Then, rinse it off.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Toning Liquid:</strong> A toning liquid is the most versatile toner formulation as you can use it in multiple ways — directly or by mixing it with your shampoo or deep conditioner. However, the specifics of its usage vary based on the product, so ensure to read the instructions manual thoroughly.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Toning Shampoo:</strong> If the shampoo you’re using is sulfate-free and rich in emollients, then it would be a good idea to let the product settle for 5-15 minutes after lathering it on wet hair. For soap-based shampoos, avoid keeping them longer than 2-3 minutes as the sulfates can strip your hair and scalp of its natural moisture. Rinse off the product after use.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Leave-in Spray:</strong> Leave-in sprays are the easiest to use from the list. All you need to do is spritz a generous amount of the product after shampooing and towel-drying your hair. You don’t need to rinse them off and the formula gets plenty of time to gradually enhance your hair color.&nbsp;</p><p>Talking about the usage of a toner, our contributor Gwenda Harmon, says, “You may use a toner around four to eight weeks for damaged hair. This is advisable to achieve your desired shade or neutralizing fragmented tones. A regular permanent toner can be used for four to six weeks between two toning operations for regular permanent toning. After this, your hair will experience regrowth.”</p><p><h2 class=title>Benefits of Using Toner for Blonde Hair</h2></p><p>Here are the benefits of using toner for blonde hair -&nbsp;</p><p>- Neutralizes brassy or yellow tones</p><p>-&nbsp;Enhances the brightness and vibrancy of blonde hair</p><p>- Eliminates discoloration</p><p>- Strengthens hair by creating a protective barrier around the tresses&nbsp;</p><p>- Adds volume and shine to blonde hair</p><p>So there you have it.
