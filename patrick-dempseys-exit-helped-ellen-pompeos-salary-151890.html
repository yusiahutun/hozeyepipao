In a candid new interview with <a href=#>The Hollywood Reporter,</a> Ellen revealed his departure actually helped her negotiate a bigger salary with ABC. “For me, Patrick leaving the show [in 2015] was a defining moment, deal-wise. They could always use him as leverage against me — ‘We don’t need you; we have Patrick’ — which they did for years. I don’t know if they also did that to him because he and I never discussed our deals,” Ellen, 48, said.</p><p>“There were many times where I reached out about joining together to negotiate, but he was never interested in that. At one point, I asked for $5,000 more than him just on principle, because the <a href=#>show</a> is Grey’s Anatomy and I’m Meredith Grey. They wouldn’t give it to me. And I could have walked away, so why didn’t I? It’s my show; I’m the number one. I’m sure I felt what a lot of these other actresses feel: Why should I walk away from a great part because of a guy? You feel conflicted, but then you figure, ‘I’m not going to let a guy drive me out of my own house,'” Ellen shared.</p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><p><img decoding=async width=1024 height=683 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.womansworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/01/ellen-pompeo-patrick-dempsey.jpg alt="Ellen Pompeo Patrick Dempsey Getty Images" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p style=text-align:center>Ellen and Patrick on Grey’s Anatomy. (Photo Credit: Getty Images)</p><p>“The truth is, the ink wasn’t even dry on his exit papers before they rushed in a new [love interest for Meredith]. I was on vacation in Sicily [Italy] decompressing — it was a long working <a href=#>relationship</a> and it was a tumultuous end, and I needed a moment to just chill with some rosé — and they’re calling me, going, ‘What do you think of this guy?’ ‘What do you think of this guy?’ And they’re sending pictures. I was like, ‘Are you people f–king nuts? Why do you feel that you have to replace this person?'” Ellen continued.</p><p>Earlier this week, news broke that Ellen had signed a new Grey’s Anatomy contract for $20 million per year — aka $575,000 per episode — through Seasons 15 and 16. According to The Hollywood Reporter, the mom-of-three’s latest deal additionally includes “a seven-figure signing bonus and two full backend equity points on the series, estimated to bring in another $6 million to $7 million. She also will get a producing fee plus backend on this spring’s Grey’s spinoff, as well as pilot commitments and office space for her Calamity Jane production company on Disney’s Burbank lot.” You go, girl!</p><p>“I’m 48 now, so I’ve finally gotten to the place where I’m OK asking for what I deserve, which is something that comes only with age,” Ellen said of her impressive new salary. “Because I’m not the most ‘relevant’ actress out there. I know that’s the industry perception because I’ve been this character for 14 years. But the truth is, anybody can be good on a show season one and two. Can you be good 14 years later? Now, that’s a f–kin’ skill.”</p><p>This article originally appeared on our sister site, <a href=#>Closer Weekly.</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>More from Closer Weekly</h2><p><a href=#>These 28 Derek Shepherd Quotes From ‘Grey’s Anatomy’ Will Totally Make You Sob</a></p><p><a href=#>‘Grey’s Anatomy’ Star Sara Ramirez Has Been up to a Lot Since Stepping Away From Showbiz</a></p><p><a href=#>Fans Still Don’t Understand Why Sandra Oh Left ‘Grey’s Anatomy’</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7p7XRrKufp6KsvK6xzWeaqKVfpby0wNJonKeslafBorXNppynrF%2BlrrW%2ByJyiZpyVor20sdisZJ6wmal6qbHLqZydZZWhuaa6jKmmpqiVpMBuv8ClmKuxXWaCcoSYaQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./steven-crowder-accused-sending-staff-photos-genitals-flashing-male-colleagues-good-mood-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Steven Crowder accused of sending staff photos of his genitals and flashing male colleagues 'when he</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jennifer-lopez-le-specs-thirst-sunglasses-sale.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jennifer Lopez's retro sunglasses are on sale and they cost less than you think</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./20-year-sentence-2003-murder-ephrata-html.html>20-year sentence for 2003 murder in Ephrata</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./3-ways-can-remove-unwanted-blog-pages-google.html>3 Ways You Can Remove Unwanted Blog Pages From Google</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./5-rewarding-benefits-of-playing-the-violin.html>5 Rewarding Benefits of Playing the Violin</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./article-fbcffa51-ae5b-5b24-ba42-7821fc682093-html.html>Child molesters are the sweetest people | Columnists</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./woman-quells-racist-row-getting-boobs-train-html.html>Woman quells racist row by getting her boobs out on train</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaX.
